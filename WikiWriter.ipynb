An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: A thermostat or other control system is considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\\n\\nLeading AI textbooks define \"artificial intelligence\" as the \"study and design of intelligent agents\", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics, \"rational agent\".\\nAn agent has an \"objective function\" that encapsulates all the IA\\'s goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize the expected value of the objective function. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a \"reward function\" that allows the programmers to shape the IA\\'s desired behavior, and an evolutionary algorithm\\'s behavior is shaped by a \"fitness function\". \\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. An autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users).',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nTitle: Economic impact analysis\\nSummary:\\nAn economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nTitle: Technological singularity\\nSummary:\\nThe technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nTitle: Automation\\nSummary:\\nAutomation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, mainly by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\",\n",

Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.\\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.\\nThe mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. \\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\",\n",

A phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent, as consumer products are embedded with digital services and devices.\\nAccording to the WEF, 70% of the global economy will be made up of digital technology over the next 10 years (from 2020 onwards). This is a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the tendency to go online. The future of work, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the digital economy. More people are now working online, and with the increase of online activity that contributes to the global economy, companies that support the systems of the Internet are more profitable.\\n\\nDigital transformation of the economy alters conventional notions about how businesses are structured, how consumers obtain goods and services, and how states need to adapt to new regulatory challenges. The digital economy has the potential to shape economic interactions between states, businesses and individuals profoundly. The emergence of the digital economy has prompted new debates over privacy rights, competition, and taxation, with calls for national and transnational regulations of the digital economy.',\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTitle: Sustainability\\nSummary:\\nSustainability is a social goal for people to co-exist on Earth over a long period of time. Definitions of this term are disputed and have varied with literature, context, and time. Sustainability usually has three dimensions (or pillars): environmental, economic, and social. Many definitions emphasize the environmental dimension. This can include addressing key environmental problems, including climate change and biodiversity loss. The idea of sustainability can guide decisions at the global, national, organizational, and individual levels. A related concept is that of sustainable development, and the terms are often used to mean the same thing. UNESCO distinguishes the two like this: \"Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it.\"\\nDetails around the economic dimension of sustainability are controversial. Scholars have discussed this under the concept of weak and strong sustainability. For example, there will always be tension between the ideas of \"welfare and prosperity for all\" and environmental conservation, so trade-offs are necessary. It would be desirable to find ways that separate economic growth from harming the environment. This means using fewer resources per unit of output even while growing the economy. This decoupling reduces the environmental impact of economic growth, such as pollution. Doing this is difficult. Some experts say there is no evidence that such a decoupling is happening at the required scale. \\nIt is challenging to measure sustainability as the concept is complex, contextual, and dynamic. Indicators have been developed to cover the environment, society, or the economy but there is no fixed definition of sustainability indicators. The metrics are evolving and include indicators, benchmarks and audits. They include sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic. They also involve indices and accounting systems such as corporate sustainability reporting and Triple Bottom Line accounting. \\nIt is necessary to address many barriers to sustainability to achieve a sustainability transition.:\\u200a34\\u200a Some barriers arise from nature and its complexity while others are extrinsic to the concept of sustainability. For example, they can result from the dominant institutional frameworks in countries.\\nGlobal issues of sustainability are difficult to tackle as they need global solutions. Existing global organizations such as the UN and WTO are seen as inefficient in enforcing current global regulations. One reason for this is the lack of suitable sanctioning mechanisms.:\\u200a135–145\\u200a Governments are not the only sources of action for sustainability. For example, business groups have tried to integrate ecological concerns with economic activity, seeking sustainable business. Religious leaders have stressed the need for caring for nature and environmental stability. Individuals can also live more sustainably.\\nSome people have criticized the idea of sustainability. One point of criticism is that the concept is vague and only a buzzword. Another is that sustainability might be an impossible goal. Some experts have pointed out that \"no country is delivering what its citizens need without transgressing the biophysical planetary boundaries\".:\\u200a11\\u200a',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nTitle: Technological unemployment\\nSummary:\\nTechnological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change. It is a key type of structural unemployment. Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes (automation), and humans\\' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor, humans\\' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing\\'s bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills and cashierless stores.\\nThat technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs, whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\". The issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle\\'s time.\\nPrior to the 18th century, both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it stayed apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"Luddite fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\\nThe view that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included David Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may increase worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their methodology has been challenged as lacking evidential foundation and criticised for implying that technology (rather than social policy) creates unemployment rather than redundancies. On the PBS NewsHours the authors defended their findings and clarified they do necessarily imply future technological unemployment. While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again. A report in Wired in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist Gene Sperling and management professor Andrew McAfee on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a \"significant issue\". Recent technological innovations have the potential to displace humans in the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other \"mental jobs\". The World Bank\\'s World Development Report 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.',\n",

It is also known as data privacy or data protection.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nTitle: Algorithmic bias\\nSummary:\\nAlgorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create \"unfair\" outcomes, such as \"privileging\" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm.\\nBias can emerge from many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect \"systematic and unfair\" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (proposed 2018) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (proposed 2021, approved 2024).\\nAs algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; by how features and labels are chosen; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software\\'s initial design.\\nAlgorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single \"algorithm\" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nTitle: Smart city\\nSummary:\\nA smart city is an urban area that has been developed with a high level of technological advancement, utilising a variety of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data. This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.',\n",

It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD. \\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks. \\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks. \\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\\n\\n',\n",

ISO TC 279 in the standard ISO 56000:2020 defines innovation as \"a new or changed entity, realizing or redistributing value\". Others have different definitions; a common element in the definitions is a focus on newness, improvement, and spread of ideas or technologies.\\nInnovation often takes place through the development of more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, art works\\nor business models that innovators make available to markets, governments and society.\\nInnovation is related to, but not the same as, invention: innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new / improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in a market or society, and not all innovations require a new invention.\\nTechnical innovation often manifests itself via the engineering process when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature.

HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways. A device that allows interaction between human being and a computer is known as a \"Human-computer Interface (HCI)\".\\nAs a field of research, human–computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study. The term was popularized by Stuart K. Card, Allen Newell, and Thomas P. Moran in their 1983 book, The Psychology of Human–Computer Interaction. The first known use was in 1975 by Carlisle. The term is intended to convey that, unlike other tools with specific and limited uses, computers have many uses which often involve an open-ended dialogue between the user and the computer. The notion of dialogue likens human–computer interaction to human-to-human interaction: an analogy that is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field.',\n",

The term was popularised in 2016 by Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum founder and executive chairman, who asserts that these developments represent a significant shift in industrial capitalism.\\nA part of this phase of industrial change is the joining of technologies like artificial intelligence, gene editing, to advanced robotics that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological worlds.\\nThroughout this, fundamental shifts are taking place in how the global production and supply network operates through ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology, large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M), and the Internet of things (IoT). This integration results in increasing automation, improving communication and self-monitoring, and the use of smart machines that can analyse and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.\\nIt also represents a social, political, and economic shift from the digital age of the late 1990s and early 2000s to an era of embedded connectivity distinguished by the ubiquity of technology in society (i.e. a metaverse) that changes the ways humans experience and know the world around them.

Using AI in healthcare has the potential improve predicting, diagnosing and treating diseases. Through machine learning algorithms and deep learning, AI can analyse large sets of clinical data and electronic health records and can help to diagnose the disease more quickly and precisely.\\nAI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care.\\nBecause radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.\\nAs widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and related industries. \\nUsing AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases.

Some believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionized with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved. Marketers often use different kinds of myths to make complex products seem simpler There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination , harmful educational practices,  or might discourage researchers from publishing their original research openly.

Furthermore, AI agents can serve as flexible tools for developers, enhancing software development processes by reacting to user inputs and automating tasks (https://blog.n8n.io/ai-agents/).\\n\\nIn terms of economic, social, and environmental impacts, AI agents could bring about significant changes. Economically, they can reduce costs and improve productivity across industries by automating routine tasks and enabling better resource management (https://yellow.ai/blog/ai-agents/). Socially, their integration could lead to shifts in job markets, with some roles becoming obsolete while new opportunities arise in AI management and oversight (https://blog.hireborderless.com/a-guide-to-ai-agents-definitions-types-examples-and-trends). Environmentally, AI agents can help optimize energy usage and resource allocation, contributing to sustainability efforts (https://medium.com/humansdotai/an-introduction-to-ai-agents-e8c4afd2ee8f). \\n\\nDespite their potential benefits, the development and deployment of AI agents also raise ethical concerns, such as issues of privacy, security, and bias in decision-making processes (https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/05/1094711/what-are-ai-agents/). As such, it is crucial to establish frameworks that govern their use and ensure they serve the greater good of society while mitigating risks associated with their deployment (https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/ai-agents-explained/).', cited_urls=['https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/07/what-is-an-ai-agent-experts-explain/', 'https://geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-agents-in-ai/', 'https://yellow.ai/blog/ai-agents/', 'https://geeky-gadgets.com/ai-agents-explained/', 'https://blog.n8n.io/ai-agents/', 'https://blog.hireborderless.com/a-guide-to-ai-agents-definitions-types-examples-and-trends', 'https://medium.com/humansdotai/an-introduction-to-ai-agents-e8c4afd2ee8f', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/05/1094711/what-are-ai-agents/']),\n",

       "'AI agents, particularly those powered by generative AI (gen AI), represent a significant evolution in the application of artificial intelligence, offering both opportunities and challenges across various sectors. These AI agents are designed to autonomously plan and execute tasks, thereby enhancing efficiency and productivity within organizations. As businesses begin to adopt these technologies, they are exploring a range of applications, from drug discovery to automating complex decision-making processes, which can lead to significant economic benefits and increased productivity for workers  [1](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/charting-a-path-to-the-data-and-ai-driven-enterprise-of-2030).  \\n\\nThe rise of autonomous AI agents is particularly noteworthy. In 2023, the concept gained traction as organizations began recognizing the potential of large language model (LLM)-powered bots that can independently reason and execute tasks. OpenAI\\'s CEO, Sam Altman, referred to these agents as \"AI\\'s killer function,\" highlighting their transformative potential [2](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/future-workforce-ai-agents/). However, the journey towards widespread adoption has encountered obstacles, including issues related to data quality, employee skepticism, and implementation costs [3](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-promise-and-the-reality-of-gen-ai-agents-in-the-enterprise).  \\n\\nOn the social front, AI agents are poised to reshape the workforce and impact job dynamics. While there are fears of job displacement due to automation, studies suggest that AI can also create new job opportunities and redefine existing roles, leading to a more skilled workforce [4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexanderpuutio/2024/03/22/what-ceos-need-to-know-about-the-next-frontier-of-ai-ai-agents/). Furthermore, the integration of AI agents into daily life could enhance personal productivity and transform how individuals manage tasks, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations in their deployment [5](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/the-ethics-of-advanced-ai-assistants).  \\n\\nThe environmental implications of AI agents also warrant attention. The training of AI models can be energy-intensive, leading to significant carbon emissions. For instance, creating a single large AI model can consume thousands of megawatt hours of electricity, raising concerns about the sustainability of AI practices [6](https://www.hbr.org/2024/07/the-uneven-distribution-of-ais-environmental-impacts). Addressing these concerns requires a multifaceted approach involving sustainable practices within the AI industry and the implementation of energy-efficient technologies [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x). As AI continues to evolve, striking a balance between its benefits and its environmental impact will be crucial for future development.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n[1]: https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/charting-a-path-to-the-data-and-ai-driven-enterprise-of-2030\\n[2]: https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/future-workforce-ai-agents/\\n[3]: https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-promise-and-the-reality-of-gen-ai-agents-in-the-enterprise\\n[4]: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexanderpuutio/2024/03/22/what-ceos-need-to-know-about-the-next-frontier-of-ai-ai-agents/\\n[5]: https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/the-ethics-of-advanced-ai-assistants\\n[6]: https://www.hbr.org/2024/07/the-uneven-distribution-of-ais-environmental-impacts\\n[7]: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x'"

       "  AIMessage(content='The economic impacts of AI agents are multifaceted, particularly concerning job displacement and creation. On one hand, AI agents are likely to displace certain jobs, especially those that involve repetitive tasks or data processing. As AI technologies become more capable of performing these roles, workers may find themselves replaced by automated systems. For example, studies suggest that AI could automate tasks across various sectors, leading to significant job losses in areas like manufacturing, retail, and customer service \\n\\nHowever, the narrative is not solely about displacement. AI agents also create new job opportunities by necessitating roles that focus on managing, enhancing, and overseeing AI systems. For instance, the demand for data scientists, AI ethics specialists, and AI maintenance personnel is expected to grow, reflecting the need for skilled individuals who can work alongside AI technologies \\n\\nAdditionally, the integration of AI agents can lead to increased productivity and efficiency, which can result in economic growth. As businesses adopt AI technologies, they may experience cost savings and improved decision-making capabilities, potentially leading to expanded operations and the creation of new jobs in emerging fields. This shift could also foster entrepreneurship, as AI agents enable small businesses to automate processes that were previously only feasible for larger companies \\n\\nFurthermore, the impact of AI on employment may vary across different demographics and regions. Reports indicate that while AI may displace lower-skilled jobs, it could also enhance job prospects for higher-skilled workers, particularly women and those in labor-intensive roles, by creating new opportunities in technology and management. This suggests a need for targeted workforce development and reskilling initiatives to prepare workers for the changing job landscape \\n\\nOverall, while AI agents will likely displace some jobs, they also hold the potential to create new roles, drive economic growth, and transform the labor market in ways that can benefit society as a whole.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n[1]: https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilsahota/2024/04/03/the-silent-shift-how-ai-stealthily-reshapes-our-work-and-future/\\n[2]: https://www.investopedia.com/economic-impact-of-generative-ai-7976252\\n[3]: https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/07/10/potential-labor-market-impacts-of-artificial-intelligence-an-empirical-analysis/\\n[4]: https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240104-ai-in-2024-five-trends-workers-need-to-know', name='subject_matter_expert'),\n",

As AI agents increasingly integrate into daily life, they raise significant issues about data collection and personal privacy. AI systems often require vast amounts of data to function effectively, which can lead to excessive surveillance and the potential misuse of personal information. For instance, generative AI tools may inadvertently memorize sensitive personal data during their training, leading to risks such as identity theft or targeted phishing attacks  \\n\\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the deployment of AI agents brings forth critical discussions about bias, accountability, and transparency. AI systems can perpetuate existing biases present in their training data, leading to unfair treatment of individuals based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status. This issue necessitates a focus on ethical AI development practices that prioritize fairness and inclusivity  \\n\\nMoreover, the increasing autonomy of AI agents poses risks related to accountability. When AI agents make decisions, particularly in sensitive areas like healthcare or law enforcement, it becomes challenging to determine who is responsible for any negative outcomes  \\n\\nAdditionally, the feminization of AI agents, such as voice assistants designed to sound female, raises concerns about reinforcing gender stereotypes and the potential objectification of women. This phenomenon can influence societal perceptions of gender roles and relationships, highlighting the need for ethical frameworks to guide the design and deployment of AI systems  \\n\\nThe social implications of AI agents thus encompass a complex interplay of privacy, ethics, and societal values, necessitating ongoing discourse and policy development to address these challenges effectively.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n[1]: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/07/ai-agents-safety-risks/678864/\\n[2]: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00754-x\\n[3]: https://www.iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks/\\n[4]: https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2024/01/24/6-critical--and-urgent--ethics-issues-with-ai/\\n[5]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00496-5', name='subject_matter_expert')],\n",

An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: A thermostat or other control system is considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\\n\\nLeading AI textbooks define \"artificial intelligence\" as the \"study and design of intelligent agents\", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics, \"rational agent\".\\nAn agent has an \"objective function\" that encapsulates all the IA\\'s goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize the expected value of the objective function. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a \"reward function\" that allows the programmers to shape the IA\\'s desired behavior, and an evolutionary algorithm\\'s behavior is shaped by a \"fitness function\". \\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. An autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users).', '\\n\\nTitle: Economic impact analysis\\nSummary:\\nAn economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: Technological singularity\\nSummary:\\nThe technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.', '\\n\\nTitle: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nThe environmental impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) may vary significantly. Many deep learning methods have significant carbon footprints and water usage. Some scientists have suggested that artificial intelligence may provide solutions to environmental problems.', \"\\n\\nTitle: Automation\\nSummary:\\nAutomation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, mainly by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\", \"\\n\\nTitle: Machine learning\\nSummary:\\nMachine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.\\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.\\nThe mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. \\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\", '\\n\\nTitle: Robotics\\nSummary:\\nRobotics is the interdisciplinary study and practice of the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.\\nWithin mechanical engineering, robotics is the design and construction of the physical structures of robots, while in computer science, robotics focuses on robotic automation algorithms. Other disciplines contributing to robotics include electrical, control, software, information, electronic, telecommunication, computer, mechatronic, and materials engineering. \\n\\nThe goal of most robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring space, mines and shipwrecks. Others replace people in jobs that are boring, repetitive, or unpleasant, such as cleaning, monitoring, transporting, and assembling. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: Digital economy\\nSummary:\\nThe digital economy is a portmanteau of digital computing and economy, and is an umbrella term that describes how traditional brick-and-mortar economic activities (production, distribution, trade) are being transformed by the Internet and World Wide Web technologies.\\nThe digital economy is backed by the spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) across all business sectors to enhance productivity. A phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent, as consumer products are embedded with digital services and devices.\\nAccording to the WEF, 70% of the global economy will be made up of digital technology over the next 10 years (from 2020 onwards). This is a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the tendency to go online. The future of work, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the digital economy. More people are now working online, and with the increase of online activity that contributes to the global economy, companies that support the systems of the Internet are more profitable.\\n\\nDigital transformation of the economy alters conventional notions about how businesses are structured, how consumers obtain goods and services, and how states need to adapt to new regulatory challenges. The digital economy has the potential to shape economic interactions between states, businesses and individuals profoundly. The emergence of the digital economy has prompted new debates over privacy rights, competition, and taxation, with calls for national and transnational regulations of the digital economy.', \"\\n\\nTitle: Knightscope\\nSummary:\\nKnightscope, Inc. is an American security camera and robotics company headquartered in Mountain View, California. Knightscope designs, builds and deploys robots called Autonomous Data Robots (ADRs) for use in monitoring people in malls, parking lots, neighborhoods and other public areas. Knightscope robots are fully autonomous using self-driving technology and are designed to alert police and security of incidents through sensors that detect weapons, read license plates and detect other suspicious activities.\\nKnightscope was founded in 2013, its founders stated that they were motivated to create autonomous security robots following the Sandy Hook School Shooting in 2012. Knightscope shipped their first robot in 2015. The company has four models of robots, designed for indoor, outdoor, and all terrain uses, as well as a model for stationary use. After several years of operation and several rounds of fundraising, primarily through equity crowdfunding, the company became public and launched an initial public offering (IPO) on January 27, 2022.\\nKnightscope is the most well known maker of fully autonomous security robots. Users of Knightscope robots have generally reported lower crime rates in the areas the robots were deployed, attributed mostly to physical deterrence by the robot's presence. Knightscope autonomous robots have raised concerns from critics over privacy and job displacement.\", '\\n\\nTitle: Ethics of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within the field that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. This includes algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. \\nIt also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks. \\nSome application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: Sustainability\\nSummary:\\nSustainability is a social goal for people to co-exist on Earth over a long period of time. Definitions of this term are disputed and have varied with literature, context, and time. Sustainability usually has three dimensions (or pillars): environmental, economic, and social. Many definitions emphasize the environmental dimension. This can include addressing key environmental problems, including climate change and biodiversity loss. The idea of sustainability can guide decisions at the global, national, organizational, and individual levels. A related concept is that of sustainable development, and the terms are often used to mean the same thing. UNESCO distinguishes the two like this: \"Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it.\"\\nDetails around the economic dimension of sustainability are controversial. Scholars have discussed this under the concept of weak and strong sustainability. For example, there will always be tension between the ideas of \"welfare and prosperity for all\" and environmental conservation, so trade-offs are necessary. It would be desirable to find ways that separate economic growth from harming the environment. This means using fewer resources per unit of output even while growing the economy. This decoupling reduces the environmental impact of economic growth, such as pollution. Doing this is difficult. Some experts say there is no evidence that such a decoupling is happening at the required scale. \\nIt is challenging to measure sustainability as the concept is complex, contextual, and dynamic. Indicators have been developed to cover the environment, society, or the economy but there is no fixed definition of sustainability indicators. The metrics are evolving and include indicators, benchmarks and audits. They include sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic. They also involve indices and accounting systems such as corporate sustainability reporting and Triple Bottom Line accounting. \\nIt is necessary to address many barriers to sustainability to achieve a sustainability transition.:\\u200a34\\u200a Some barriers arise from nature and its complexity while others are extrinsic to the concept of sustainability. For example, they can result from the dominant institutional frameworks in countries.\\nGlobal issues of sustainability are difficult to tackle as they need global solutions. Existing global organizations such as the UN and WTO are seen as inefficient in enforcing current global regulations. One reason for this is the lack of suitable sanctioning mechanisms.:\\u200a135–145\\u200a Governments are not the only sources of action for sustainability. For example, business groups have tried to integrate ecological concerns with economic activity, seeking sustainable business. Religious leaders have stressed the need for caring for nature and environmental stability. Individuals can also live more sustainably.\\nSome people have criticized the idea of sustainability. One point of criticism is that the concept is vague and only a buzzword. Another is that sustainability might be an impossible goal. Some experts have pointed out that \"no country is delivering what its citizens need without transgressing the biophysical planetary boundaries\".:\\u200a11\\u200a', '\\n\\nTitle: Smart city\\nSummary:\\nA smart city is an urban area that has been developed with a high level of technological advancement, utilising a variety of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data. This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.', '\\n\\nTitle: Information privacy\\nSummary:\\nInformation privacy is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, contextual information norms, and the legal and political issues surrounding them. It is also known as data privacy or data protection.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: Algorithmic bias\\nSummary:\\nAlgorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create \"unfair\" outcomes, such as \"privileging\" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm.\\nBias can emerge from many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect \"systematic and unfair\" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (proposed 2018) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (proposed 2021, approved 2024).\\nAs algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; by how features and labels are chosen; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software\\'s initial design.\\nAlgorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single \"algorithm\" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.', '\\n\\nTitle: Regulation of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nRegulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI). It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD. \\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks. \\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks. \\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: The Future of Work and Death\\nSummary:\\nThe Future of Work and Death is a 2016 documentary by Sean Blacknell and Wayne Walsh about the exponential growth of technology.\\nThe film showed at several film festivals including Raindance Film Festival, International Film Festival Rotterdam, Academia Film Olomouc and CPH:DOX.\\nIn May 2017 it received an official screening at the European Commission. It was distributed by First Run Features and Journeyman Pictures and was released on iTunes, Amazon Prime and On-demand on 9 May 2017. The film was made available on Sundance Now on 27 November 2017. A companion piece to the film, The Cost of Living, a documentary concerning universal basic income in Britain, was released on Amazon Prime on 8 October 2020.', '\\n\\nTitle: Artificial intelligence art\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence art is visual artwork created through the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) program.   \\nArtists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human–AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, artists have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.\\nThe increased availability of AI art tools to the general public in the 2020s AI boom provided opportunities for creating AI generated images outside of academia and professional artists. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.', '\\n\\nTitle: Technological unemployment\\nSummary:\\nTechnological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change. It is a key type of structural unemployment. Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes (automation), and humans\\' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor, humans\\' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing\\'s bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills and cashierless stores.\\nThat technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs, whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\". The issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle\\'s time.\\nPrior to the 18th century, both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it stayed apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"Luddite fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\\nThe view that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included David Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may increase worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their methodology has been challenged as lacking evidential foundation and criticised for implying that technology (rather than social policy) creates unemployment rather than redundancies. On the PBS NewsHours the authors defended their findings and clarified they do necessarily imply future technological unemployment. While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again. A report in Wired in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist Gene Sperling and management professor Andrew McAfee on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a \"significant issue\". Recent technological innovations have the potential to displace humans in the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other \"mental jobs\". The World Bank\\'s World Development Report 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.', \"\\n\\nTitle: Health and environmental impact of the petroleum industry\\nSummary:\\nThe environmental impact of the petroleum industry is extensive and expansive due to petroleum having many uses.\\nCrude oil and natural gas are primary energy and raw material sources that enable numerous aspects of modern daily life and the world economy.\\nTheir supply has grown quickly over the last 150 years to meet the demands of the rapidly increasing human population, creativity, knowledge, and consumerism.\\nSubstantial quantities of toxic and non-toxic waste are generated during the extraction, refinement, and transportation stages of oil and gas.\\nSome industry by-products, such as volatile organic compounds, nitrogen & sulfur compounds, and spilled oil can pollute the air, water and soil at levels that are harmful to life, when improperly managed.\\nClimate warming, ocean acidification, and sea level rise are global changes enhanced by the industry's emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, and micro-particulate aerosols like black carbon. Vehicle tailpipe emissions kill many people.\\nAmong all human activities, fossil fuel combustion is the largest contributor to the ongoing buildup of carbon in the Earth's biosphere.\\nThe International Energy Agency and others report that oil & gas use comprises over 55% (18 billion tons) of the recorded 32.8 billion tons (BT) of CO2 released into the atmosphere from all energy sources in year 2017.\\nCoal use comprised most of the remaining 45%.  Total emissions continue to rise nearly every year: from 1.7% to 33.1 BT in 2018.\\nThrough its operations, the petroleum industry directly contributed about 8% (2.7 BT) of the 32.8 BT in 2017.\\nAlso, due to its intentional and other releases of natural gas, the industry directly contributed at least 79 million tons of methane (2.4 BT CO2-equivalent) that same year; an amount equal to about 14% of all known anthropogenic and natural emissions of the potent warming gas.\\nAlong with fuels like gasoline and liquified natural gas, petroleum enables many consumer chemicals and products, such as fertilizers and plastics.\\nMost alternative technologies for energy generation, transportation, and storage can only be realized at this time because of its diverse usefulness.\\nConservation, efficiency, and minimizing waste impacts of petroleum products are effective industry and consumer actions toward achieving better environmental sustainability.\", '\\n\\nTitle: Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence in healthcare is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and understanding of complex medical and health care data. It can also augment and exceed human capabilities by providing faster or new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Using AI in healthcare has the potential improve predicting, diagnosing and treating diseases. Through machine learning algorithms and deep learning, AI can analyse large sets of clinical data and electronic health records and can help to diagnose the disease more quickly and precisely.\\nAI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care.\\nBecause radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.\\nAs widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and related industries. \\nUsing AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases. Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: AI in education\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence or Ai is a broad “skewer” term that has specific areas of study clustered next to it, including machine learning, natural language processing, the philosophy of artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and TESCREAL. Research about AI in higher education is widespread in the global north, where there is much hype from venture capital, big tech and some open educationalists. Some believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionized with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved. Marketers often use different kinds of myths to make complex products seem simpler There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination , harmful educational practices,  or might discourage researchers from publishing their original research openly.  Worries about AI safety risks such as privacy breaches, algorithmic biases, security concerns, ethics, and compliance barriers are accompanied by other doomsday warnings.', '\\n\\nTitle: The MANIAC\\nSummary:\\nThe MANIAC is a 2023 novel by Chilean author Benjamín Labatut, written in English. It is a fictionalised biography of polymath John von Neumann, whom Labatut calls \"the smartest human being of the 20th century\". The book focuses on von Neumann, but is also about physicist Paul Ehrenfest, history of artificial intelligence, and Lee Sedol\\'s Go match against AlphaGo.

An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: A thermostat or other control system is considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\\n\\nLeading AI textbooks define \"artificial intelligence\" as the \"study and design of intelligent agents\", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics, \"rational agent\".\\nAn agent has an \"objective function\" that encapsulates all the IA\\'s goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize the expected value of the objective function. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a \"reward function\" that allows the programmers to shape the IA\\'s desired behavior, and an evolutionary algorithm\\'s behavior is shaped by a \"fitness function\". \\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. An autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users).', '\\n\\nTitle: Economic impact analysis\\nSummary:\\nAn economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: Technological singularity\\nSummary:\\nThe technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.', '\\n\\nTitle: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nThe environmental impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) may vary significantly. Many deep learning methods have significant carbon footprints and water usage. Some scientists have suggested that artificial intelligence may provide solutions to environmental problems.', \"\\n\\nTitle: Automation\\nSummary:\\nAutomation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, mainly by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\", \"\\n\\nTitle: Machine learning\\nSummary:\\nMachine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.\\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.\\nThe mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. \\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\", '\\n\\nTitle: Robotics\\nSummary:\\nRobotics is the interdisciplinary study and practice of the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.\\nWithin mechanical engineering, robotics is the design and construction of the physical structures of robots, while in computer science, robotics focuses on robotic automation algorithms. Other disciplines contributing to robotics include electrical, control, software, information, electronic, telecommunication, computer, mechatronic, and materials engineering. \\n\\nThe goal of most robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring space, mines and shipwrecks. Others replace people in jobs that are boring, repetitive, or unpleasant, such as cleaning, monitoring, transporting, and assembling. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: Digital economy\\nSummary:\\nThe digital economy is a portmanteau of digital computing and economy, and is an umbrella term that describes how traditional brick-and-mortar economic activities (production, distribution, trade) are being transformed by the Internet and World Wide Web technologies.\\nThe digital economy is backed by the spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) across all business sectors to enhance productivity. A phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent, as consumer products are embedded with digital services and devices.\\nAccording to the WEF, 70% of the global economy will be made up of digital technology over the next 10 years (from 2020 onwards). This is a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the tendency to go online. The future of work, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the digital economy. More people are now working online, and with the increase of online activity that contributes to the global economy, companies that support the systems of the Internet are more profitable.\\n\\nDigital transformation of the economy alters conventional notions about how businesses are structured, how consumers obtain goods and services, and how states need to adapt to new regulatory challenges. The digital economy has the potential to shape economic interactions between states, businesses and individuals profoundly. The emergence of the digital economy has prompted new debates over privacy rights, competition, and taxation, with calls for national and transnational regulations of the digital economy.', \"\\n\\nTitle: Knightscope\\nSummary:\\nKnightscope, Inc. is an American security camera and robotics company headquartered in Mountain View, California. Knightscope designs, builds and deploys robots called Autonomous Data Robots (ADRs) for use in monitoring people in malls, parking lots, neighborhoods and other public areas. Knightscope robots are fully autonomous using self-driving technology and are designed to alert police and security of incidents through sensors that detect weapons, read license plates and detect other suspicious activities.\\nKnightscope was founded in 2013, its founders stated that they were motivated to create autonomous security robots following the Sandy Hook School Shooting in 2012. Knightscope shipped their first robot in 2015. The company has four models of robots, designed for indoor, outdoor, and all terrain uses, as well as a model for stationary use. After several years of operation and several rounds of fundraising, primarily through equity crowdfunding, the company became public and launched an initial public offering (IPO) on January 27, 2022.\\nKnightscope is the most well known maker of fully autonomous security robots. Users of Knightscope robots have generally reported lower crime rates in the areas the robots were deployed, attributed mostly to physical deterrence by the robot's presence. Knightscope autonomous robots have raised concerns from critics over privacy and job displacement.\", '\\n\\nTitle: Ethics of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within the field that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. This includes algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. \\nIt also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks. \\nSome application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: Sustainability\\nSummary:\\nSustainability is a social goal for people to co-exist on Earth over a long period of time. Definitions of this term are disputed and have varied with literature, context, and time. Sustainability usually has three dimensions (or pillars): environmental, economic, and social. Many definitions emphasize the environmental dimension. This can include addressing key environmental problems, including climate change and biodiversity loss. The idea of sustainability can guide decisions at the global, national, organizational, and individual levels. A related concept is that of sustainable development, and the terms are often used to mean the same thing. UNESCO distinguishes the two like this: \"Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it.\"\\nDetails around the economic dimension of sustainability are controversial. Scholars have discussed this under the concept of weak and strong sustainability. For example, there will always be tension between the ideas of \"welfare and prosperity for all\" and environmental conservation, so trade-offs are necessary. It would be desirable to find ways that separate economic growth from harming the environment. This means using fewer resources per unit of output even while growing the economy. This decoupling reduces the environmental impact of economic growth, such as pollution. Doing this is difficult. Some experts say there is no evidence that such a decoupling is happening at the required scale. \\nIt is challenging to measure sustainability as the concept is complex, contextual, and dynamic. Indicators have been developed to cover the environment, society, or the economy but there is no fixed definition of sustainability indicators. The metrics are evolving and include indicators, benchmarks and audits. They include sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic. They also involve indices and accounting systems such as corporate sustainability reporting and Triple Bottom Line accounting. \\nIt is necessary to address many barriers to sustainability to achieve a sustainability transition.:\\u200a34\\u200a Some barriers arise from nature and its complexity while others are extrinsic to the concept of sustainability. For example, they can result from the dominant institutional frameworks in countries.\\nGlobal issues of sustainability are difficult to tackle as they need global solutions. Existing global organizations such as the UN and WTO are seen as inefficient in enforcing current global regulations. One reason for this is the lack of suitable sanctioning mechanisms.:\\u200a135–145\\u200a Governments are not the only sources of action for sustainability. For example, business groups have tried to integrate ecological concerns with economic activity, seeking sustainable business. Religious leaders have stressed the need for caring for nature and environmental stability. Individuals can also live more sustainably.\\nSome people have criticized the idea of sustainability. One point of criticism is that the concept is vague and only a buzzword. Another is that sustainability might be an impossible goal. Some experts have pointed out that \"no country is delivering what its citizens need without transgressing the biophysical planetary boundaries\".:\\u200a11\\u200a', '\\n\\nTitle: Smart city\\nSummary:\\nA smart city is an urban area that has been developed with a high level of technological advancement, utilising a variety of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data. This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.', '\\n\\nTitle: Information privacy\\nSummary:\\nInformation privacy is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, contextual information norms, and the legal and political issues surrounding them. It is also known as data privacy or data protection.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: Algorithmic bias\\nSummary:\\nAlgorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create \"unfair\" outcomes, such as \"privileging\" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm.\\nBias can emerge from many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect \"systematic and unfair\" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (proposed 2018) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (proposed 2021, approved 2024).\\nAs algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; by how features and labels are chosen; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software\\'s initial design.\\nAlgorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single \"algorithm\" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.', '\\n\\nTitle: Regulation of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nRegulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI). It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD. \\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks. \\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks. \\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: The Future of Work and Death\\nSummary:\\nThe Future of Work and Death is a 2016 documentary by Sean Blacknell and Wayne Walsh about the exponential growth of technology.\\nThe film showed at several film festivals including Raindance Film Festival, International Film Festival Rotterdam, Academia Film Olomouc and CPH:DOX.\\nIn May 2017 it received an official screening at the European Commission. It was distributed by First Run Features and Journeyman Pictures and was released on iTunes, Amazon Prime and On-demand on 9 May 2017. The film was made available on Sundance Now on 27 November 2017. A companion piece to the film, The Cost of Living, a documentary concerning universal basic income in Britain, was released on Amazon Prime on 8 October 2020.', '\\n\\nTitle: Artificial intelligence art\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence art is visual artwork created through the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) program.   \\nArtists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human–AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, artists have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.\\nThe increased availability of AI art tools to the general public in the 2020s AI boom provided opportunities for creating AI generated images outside of academia and professional artists. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.', '\\n\\nTitle: Technological unemployment\\nSummary:\\nTechnological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change. It is a key type of structural unemployment. Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes (automation), and humans\\' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor, humans\\' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing\\'s bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills and cashierless stores.\\nThat technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs, whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\". The issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle\\'s time.\\nPrior to the 18th century, both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it stayed apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"Luddite fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\\nThe view that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included David Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may increase worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their methodology has been challenged as lacking evidential foundation and criticised for implying that technology (rather than social policy) creates unemployment rather than redundancies. On the PBS NewsHours the authors defended their findings and clarified they do necessarily imply future technological unemployment. While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again. A report in Wired in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist Gene Sperling and management professor Andrew McAfee on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a \"significant issue\". Recent technological innovations have the potential to displace humans in the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other \"mental jobs\". The World Bank\\'s World Development Report 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.', \"\\n\\nTitle: Health and environmental impact of the petroleum industry\\nSummary:\\nThe environmental impact of the petroleum industry is extensive and expansive due to petroleum having many uses.\\nCrude oil and natural gas are primary energy and raw material sources that enable numerous aspects of modern daily life and the world economy.\\nTheir supply has grown quickly over the last 150 years to meet the demands of the rapidly increasing human population, creativity, knowledge, and consumerism.\\nSubstantial quantities of toxic and non-toxic waste are generated during the extraction, refinement, and transportation stages of oil and gas.\\nSome industry by-products, such as volatile organic compounds, nitrogen & sulfur compounds, and spilled oil can pollute the air, water and soil at levels that are harmful to life, when improperly managed.\\nClimate warming, ocean acidification, and sea level rise are global changes enhanced by the industry's emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, and micro-particulate aerosols like black carbon. Vehicle tailpipe emissions kill many people.\\nAmong all human activities, fossil fuel combustion is the largest contributor to the ongoing buildup of carbon in the Earth's biosphere.\\nThe International Energy Agency and others report that oil & gas use comprises over 55% (18 billion tons) of the recorded 32.8 billion tons (BT) of CO2 released into the atmosphere from all energy sources in year 2017.\\nCoal use comprised most of the remaining 45%.  Total emissions continue to rise nearly every year: from 1.7% to 33.1 BT in 2018.\\nThrough its operations, the petroleum industry directly contributed about 8% (2.7 BT) of the 32.8 BT in 2017.\\nAlso, due to its intentional and other releases of natural gas, the industry directly contributed at least 79 million tons of methane (2.4 BT CO2-equivalent) that same year; an amount equal to about 14% of all known anthropogenic and natural emissions of the potent warming gas.\\nAlong with fuels like gasoline and liquified natural gas, petroleum enables many consumer chemicals and products, such as fertilizers and plastics.\\nMost alternative technologies for energy generation, transportation, and storage can only be realized at this time because of its diverse usefulness.\\nConservation, efficiency, and minimizing waste impacts of petroleum products are effective industry and consumer actions toward achieving better environmental sustainability.\", '\\n\\nTitle: Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence in healthcare is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and understanding of complex medical and health care data. It can also augment and exceed human capabilities by providing faster or new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Using AI in healthcare has the potential improve predicting, diagnosing and treating diseases. Through machine learning algorithms and deep learning, AI can analyse large sets of clinical data and electronic health records and can help to diagnose the disease more quickly and precisely.\\nAI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care.\\nBecause radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.\\nAs widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and related industries. \\nUsing AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases. Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nTitle: AI in education\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence or Ai is a broad “skewer” term that has specific areas of study clustered next to it, including machine learning, natural language processing, the philosophy of artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and TESCREAL. Research about AI in higher education is widespread in the global north, where there is much hype from venture capital, big tech and some open educationalists. Some believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionized with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved. Marketers often use different kinds of myths to make complex products seem simpler There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination , harmful educational practices,  or might discourage researchers from publishing their original research openly.  Worries about AI safety risks such as privacy breaches, algorithmic biases, security concerns, ethics, and compliance barriers are accompanied by other doomsday warnings.', '\\n\\nTitle: The MANIAC\\nSummary:\\nThe MANIAC is a 2023 novel by Chilean author Benjamín Labatut, written in English. It is a fictionalised biography of polymath John von Neumann, whom Labatut calls \"the smartest human being of the 20th century\". The book focuses on von Neumann, but is also about physicist Paul Ehrenfest, history of artificial intelligence, and Lee Sedol\\'s Go match against AlphaGo.
