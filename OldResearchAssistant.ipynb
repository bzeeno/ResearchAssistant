An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: A thermostat or other control system is considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\\n\\nLeading AI textbooks define \"artificial intelligence\" as the \"study and design of intelligent agents\", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics, \"rational agent\".\\nAn agent has an \"objective function\" that encapsulates all the IA\\'s goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize the expected value of the objective function. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a \"reward function\" that allows the programmers to shape the IA\\'s desired behavior, and an evolutionary algorithm\\'s behavior is shaped by a \"fitness function\". \\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. An autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users).\\n\\n\\nCategories: All Wikipedia neutral point of view disputes, All articles that may contain original research, Articles that may contain original research from February 2023, Articles with BNF identifiers, Articles with BNFdata identifiers, Articles with J9U identifiers, Articles with LCCN identifiers, Articles with short description, Artificial intelligence, Short description matches Wikidata, Wikipedia neutral point of view disputes from September 2023',\n",

It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.\\nCategories: Articles with excerpts, Articles with short description, CS1 errors: missing periodical, Economics, Evaluation methods, Short description matches Wikidata, Webarchive template wayback links',\n",
       " '\\n\\nTitle: Technological singularity\\nSummary:\\nThe technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.\\nCategories: All articles that may have off-topic sections, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles with hAudio microformats, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from April 2018, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2012, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017, Articles with unsourced statements from May 2024, CS1: long volume value, Existential risk from artificial general intelligence, Harv and Sfn no-target errors, IMDb title ID not in Wikidata, Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback via Module:Annotated link, Philosophy of artificial intelligence, Science fiction themes, Short description is different from Wikidata, Singularitarianism, Spoken articles, Use dmy dates from March 2023, Webarchive template wayback links, Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2024, Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from May 2024, Wikipedia articles that may have off-topic sections from October 2021',\n",

       " \"\\n\\nTitle: Automation\\nSummary:\\nAutomation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, mainly by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\\nCategories: All accuracy disputes, All articles needing additional references, All articles that may contain original research, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles containing video clips, Articles needing additional references from May 2019, Articles that may contain original research from March 2018, Articles with BNE identifiers, Articles with BNF identifiers, Articles with BNFdata identifiers, Articles with GND identifiers, Articles with J9U identifiers, Articles with LCCN identifiers, Articles with NDL identifiers, Articles with NKC identifiers, Articles with disputed statements from October 2013, Articles with excerpts, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from June 2024, Articles with unsourced statements from May 2021, Articles with unsourced statements from October 2013, Articles with unsourced statements from September 2017, Automation, CS1 French-language sources (fr), CS1 German-language sources (de), CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of July 2024, Free-content attribution, Free content from FAO, Pages using Sister project links with default search, Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch, Short description is different from Wikidata, Use dmy dates from July 2020, Webarchive template wayback links, Wikipedia further reading cleanup, Wikipedia spam cleanup from March 2023\",\n",

A phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent, as consumer products are embedded with digital services and devices.\\nAccording to the WEF, 70% of the global economy will be made up of digital technology over the next 10 years (from 2020 onwards). This is a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the tendency to go online. The future of work, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the digital economy. More people are now working online, and with the increase of online activity that contributes to the global economy, companies that support the systems of the Internet are more profitable.\\n\\nDigital transformation of the economy alters conventional notions about how businesses are structured, how consumers obtain goods and services, and how states need to adapt to new regulatory challenges. The digital economy has the potential to shape economic interactions between states, businesses and individuals profoundly.

       " '\\n\\nTitle: Sustainability\\nSummary:\\nSustainability is a social goal for people to co-exist on Earth over a long period of time. Definitions of this term are disputed and have varied with literature, context, and time. Sustainability usually has three dimensions (or pillars): environmental, economic, and social. Many definitions emphasize the environmental dimension. This can include addressing key environmental problems, including climate change and biodiversity loss. The idea of sustainability can guide decisions at the global, national, organizational, and individual levels. A related concept is that of sustainable development, and the terms are often used to mean the same thing. UNESCO distinguishes the two like this: \"Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it.\"\\nDetails around the economic dimension of sustainability are controversial. Scholars have discussed this under the concept of weak and strong sustainability. For example, there will always be tension between the ideas of \"welfare and prosperity for all\" and environmental conservation, so trade-offs are necessary. It would be desirable to find ways that separate economic growth from harming the environment. This means using fewer resources per unit of output even while growing the economy. This decoupling reduces the environmental impact of economic growth, such as pollution. Doing this is difficult. Some experts say there is no evidence that such a decoupling is happening at the required scale. \\nIt is challenging to measure sustainability as the concept is complex, contextual, and dynamic. Indicators have been developed to cover the environment, society, or the economy but there is no fixed definition of sustainability indicators. The metrics are evolving and include indicators, benchmarks and audits. They include sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic. They also involve indices and accounting systems such as corporate sustainability reporting and Triple Bottom Line accounting. \\nIt is necessary to address many barriers to sustainability to achieve a sustainability transition.:\\u200a34\\u200a Some barriers arise from nature and its complexity while others are extrinsic to the concept of sustainability. For example, they can result from the dominant institutional frameworks in countries.\\nGlobal issues of sustainability are difficult to tackle as they need global solutions. Existing global organizations such as the UN and WTO are seen as inefficient in enforcing current global regulations. One reason for this is the lack of suitable sanctioning mechanisms.:\\u200a135–145\\u200a Governments are not the only sources of action for sustainability. For example, business groups have tried to integrate ecological concerns with economic activity, seeking sustainable business. Religious leaders have stressed the need for caring for nature and environmental stability. Individuals can also live more sustainably.\\nSome people have criticized the idea of sustainability. One point of criticism is that the concept is vague and only a buzzword. Another is that sustainability might be an impossible goal.

       " '\\n\\nTitle: Technology adoption life cycle\\nSummary:\\nThe technology adoption lifecycle is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or \"bell curve\". The model calls the first group of people to use a new product \"innovators\", followed by \"early adopters\". Next come the \"early majority\" and \"late majority\", and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called \"laggards\" or \"phobics\". For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.\\nThe demographic and psychological (or \"psychographic\") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by agricultural researchers in 1956:\\n\\ninnovators – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented\\nearly adopters – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous\\nearly majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbors\\nlate majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active\\nlaggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated\\nThe model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century, for example in the spread of policy innovations among U.S. states. \\n\\n\\nCategories: Articles with short description, Demographics, Diffusion, Innovation economics, Management cybernetics, Product development, Product lifecycle management, Product management, Science and technology studies, Short description is different from Wikidata, Sociology of culture, Technological change, Technology in society, Webarchive template wayback links',\n",

       " '\\n\\nTitle: Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence in healthcare is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and understanding of complex medical and health care data. It can also augment and exceed human capabilities by providing faster or new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Using AI in healthcare has the potential improve predicting, diagnosing and treating diseases. Through machine learning algorithms and deep learning, AI can analyse large sets of clinical data and electronic health records and can help to diagnose the disease more quickly and precisely.\\nAI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care.\\nBecause radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.\\nAs widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and related industries. \\nUsing AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases. Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.\\n\\n\\nCategories: Applications of artificial intelligence, Articles with excerpts, Articles with short description, Computing in medical imaging, Cybernetics, Health software, Medical devices, Short description is different from Wikidata, Webarchive template wayback links, Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from June 2019',\n",

Research about AI in higher education is widespread in the global north, where there is much hype from venture capital, big tech and some open educationalists. Some believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionized with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved.  There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination and harmful educational practices.  Worries about AI safety risks such as privacy breaches, algorithmic biases, security concerns, ethics, and compliance barriers are accompanied by other doomsday warnings.\\n\\n\\nCategories: Applications of artificial intelligence, Articles with short description, Artificial intelligence, CS1 errors: generic name, Short description with empty Wikidata description',\n",
       " '\\n\\nTitle: Smart city\\nSummary:\\nA smart city is an urban area that has been developed with a high level of technological advancement, utilising a variety of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data. This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.\\nCategories: All articles needing copy edit, All articles with style issues, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2024, CS1 maint: location missing publisher, Commons category link from Wikidata, Government by algorithm, Harv and Sfn no-target errors, Short description is different from Wikidata, Smart cities, Urban planning in China, Urban studies and planning terminology, Use dmy dates from February 2019, Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2024, Wikipedia articles needing copy edit from July 2024, Wikipedia articles with style issues from July 2024',\n",

It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD. \\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks. \\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks. \\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\\n\\n\\nCategories: All articles containing potentially dated statements, All articles needing additional references, Articles containing potentially dated statements from July 2023, Articles needing additional references from October 2023, Articles with excerpts, Articles with imported Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 text, Articles with short description, CS1 German-language sources (de), CS1 Spanish-language sources (es), Computer law, Existential risk from artificial general intelligence, Politics and technology, Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of technologies, Short description is different from Wikidata',\n",

Markov's inequality is tight in the sense that for each chosen positive constant, there exists a random variable such that the inequality is in fact an equality.\\nIt is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, although it appeared earlier in the work of Pafnuty Chebyshev (Markov's teacher), and many sources, especially in analysis, refer to it as Chebyshev's inequality (sometimes, calling it the first Chebyshev inequality, while referring to Chebyshev's inequality as the second Chebyshev inequality) or Bienaymé's inequality.\\nMarkov's inequality (and other similar inequalities) relate probabilities to expectations, and provide (frequently loose but still useful) bounds for the cumulative distribution function of a random variable. Markov's inequality can also be used to upper bound the expectation of a non-negative random variable in terms of its distribution function.\\nCategories: All articles needing additional references, Articles containing proofs, Articles needing additional references from September 2010, Articles with short description, Probabilistic inequalities, Short description is different from Wikidata\"]"

       "'AI agents are poised to significantly impact various industries economically, with effects ranging from increased productivity to shifts in labor markets. In manufacturing, AI technologies such as robotics and automation are enhancing operational efficiency, leading to reduced production costs and faster output, which can increase profit margins for companies. This transformation is projected to also lead to a potential decrease in manufacturing jobs as machines take over routine tasks, although it may create new opportunities in AI management and maintenance roles.\\n\\nIn healthcare, AI agents can analyze patient data and improve diagnostic accuracy, which can reduce costs associated with misdiagnoses and ineffective treatments. The integration of AI into healthcare is expected to optimize processes, leading to significant savings for both providers and patients, while also improving patient outcomes through personalized medicine.\\n\\nThe finance industry is experiencing profound changes due to AI, particularly in risk assessment and fraud detection. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data more swiftly than humans, allowing for better investment strategies and enhanced security measures. This can lead to cost reductions for financial institutions and lower fees for consumers, although it may also disrupt traditional banking jobs as AI systems take on roles traditionally held by human analysts.\\n\\nIn retail, AI agents are enhancing customer experiences through personalized recommendations and optimizing inventory management, which can lead to increased sales and reduced waste. The economic impact here includes improved customer loyalty and operational efficiency, although there are concerns about job displacement in retail roles due to increased automation.\\n\\nFinally, the transportation sector is being revolutionized by AI through advancements in autonomous vehicles and logistics optimization. These technologies promise to reduce operational costs and improve safety, potentially transforming economic models within the industry. However, this shift may also lead to job losses in driving and related fields, necessitating workforce retraining initiatives.\\n\\nOverall, while AI agents are expected to drive economic growth and efficiency, they also present challenges such as job displacement and the need for workforce adaptation to new technologies.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n[1]: https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence\\n[2]: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2021/12/13/the-impact-of-ai-on-the-global-economy/\\n[3]: https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/what-is-the-economic-impact-of-ai-on-the-global-economy\\n[4]: https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/research-insights/ai-economic-impact.html\\n[5]: https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-06-gartner-says-three-emerging-ai-applications-will-create-2-3-million-jobs-by-2022'"
