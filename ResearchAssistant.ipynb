       "['\\n\\nTitle: Artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and the long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nTitle: Economic impact analysis\\nSummary:\\nAn economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nTitle: Technological singularity\\nSummary:\\nThe technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.',\n",

Many deep learning methods have significant carbon footprints and water usage. Some scientists have suggested that artificial intelligence may provide solutions to environmental problems.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nTitle: Automation\\nSummary:\\nAutomation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, mainly by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\",\n",

Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.\\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.\\nThe mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. \\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\",\n",

Other disciplines contributing to robotics include electrical, control, software, information, electronic, telecommunication, computer, mechatronic, and materials engineering. \\n\\nThe goal of most robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring space, mines and shipwrecks. Others replace people in jobs that are boring, repetitive, or unpleasant, such as cleaning, monitoring, transporting, and assembling. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes.',\n",

A phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent, as consumer products are embedded with digital services and devices.\\nAccording to the WEF, 70% of the global economy will be made up of digital technology over the next 10 years (from 2020 onwards). This is a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the tendency to go online. The future of work, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the digital economy. More people are now working online, and with the increase of online activity that contributes to the global economy, companies that support the systems of the Internet are more profitable.\\n\\nDigital transformation of the economy alters conventional notions about how businesses are structured, how consumers obtain goods and services, and how states need to adapt to new regulatory challenges. The digital economy has the potential to shape economic interactions between states, businesses and individuals profoundly. The emergence of the digital economy has prompted new debates over privacy rights, competition, and taxation, with calls for national and transnational regulations of the digital economy.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nTitle: Labour economics\\nSummary:\\nLabour economics, or labor economics, seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour. Labour is a commodity that is supplied by labourers, usually in exchange for a wage paid by demanding firms. Because these labourers exist as parts of a social, institutional, or political system, labour economics must also account for social, cultural and political variables.\\nLabour markets or job markets function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers) and the demanders of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. These patterns exist because each individual in the market is presumed to make rational choices based on the information that they know regarding wage, desire to provide labour, and desire for leisure. Labour markets are normally geographically bounded, but the rise of the internet has brought about a 'planetary labour market' in some sectors.\\nLabour is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with other factors of production, such as land and capital. Some theories focus on human capital, or entrepreneurship, (which refers to the skills that workers possess and not necessarily the actual work that they produce). Labour is unique to study because it is a special type of good that cannot be separated from the owner (i.e. the work cannot be separated from the person who does it). A labour market is also different from other markets in that workers are the suppliers and firms are the demanders.\",\n",

       " '\\n\\nTitle: Sustainability\\nSummary:\\nSustainability is a social goal for people to co-exist on Earth over a long period of time. Definitions of this term are disputed and have varied with literature, context, and time. Sustainability usually has three dimensions (or pillars): environmental, economic, and social. Many definitions emphasize the environmental dimension. This can include addressing key environmental problems, including climate change and biodiversity loss. The idea of sustainability can guide decisions at the global, national, organizational, and individual levels. A related concept is that of sustainable development, and the terms are often used to mean the same thing. UNESCO distinguishes the two like this: \"Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it.\"\\nDetails around the economic dimension of sustainability are controversial. Scholars have discussed this under the concept of weak and strong sustainability. For example, there will always be tension between the ideas of \"welfare and prosperity for all\" and environmental conservation, so trade-offs are necessary. It would be desirable to find ways that separate economic growth from harming the environment. This means using fewer resources per unit of output even while growing the economy. This decoupling reduces the environmental impact of economic growth, such as pollution. Doing this is difficult. Some experts say there is no evidence that such a decoupling is happening at the required scale. \\nIt is challenging to measure sustainability as the concept is complex, contextual, and dynamic. Indicators have been developed to cover the environment, society, or the economy but there is no fixed definition of sustainability indicators. The metrics are evolving and include indicators, benchmarks and audits. They include sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic. They also involve indices and accounting systems such as corporate sustainability reporting and Triple Bottom Line accounting. \\nIt is necessary to address many barriers to sustainability to achieve a sustainability transition.:\\u200a34\\u200a Some barriers arise from nature and its complexity while others are extrinsic to the concept of sustainability. For example, they can result from the dominant institutional frameworks in countries.\\nGlobal issues of sustainability are difficult to tackle as they need global solutions. Existing global organizations such as the UN and WTO are seen as inefficient in enforcing current global regulations. One reason for this is the lack of suitable sanctioning mechanisms.:\\u200a135–145\\u200a Governments are not the only sources of action for sustainability. For example, business groups have tried to integrate ecological concerns with economic activity, seeking sustainable business. Religious leaders have stressed the need for caring for nature and environmental stability. Individuals can also live more sustainably.\\nSome people have criticized the idea of sustainability. One point of criticism is that the concept is vague and only a buzzword. Another is that sustainability might be an impossible goal. Some experts have pointed out that \"no country is delivering what its citizens need without transgressing the biophysical planetary boundaries\".:\\u200a11\\u200a',\n",
       " '\\n\\nTitle: Technological unemployment\\nSummary:\\nTechnological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change. It is a key type of structural unemployment. Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes (automation), and humans\\' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor, humans\\' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing\\'s bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills and cashierless stores.\\nThat technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs, whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\". The issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle\\'s time.\\nPrior to the 18th century, both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it stayed apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"Luddite fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\\nThe view that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included David Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may increase worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their methodology has been challenged as lacking evidential foundation and criticised for implying that technology (rather than social policy) creates unemployment rather than redundancies. On the PBS NewsHours the authors defended their findings and clarified they do necessarily imply future technological unemployment. While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again. A report in Wired in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist Gene Sperling and management professor Andrew McAfee on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a \"significant issue\". Recent technological innovations have the potential to displace humans in the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other \"mental jobs\". The World Bank\\'s World Development Report 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nTitle: Smart city\\nSummary:\\nA smart city is an urban area that has been developed with a high level of technological advancement, utilising a variety of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data. This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nTitle: Information privacy\\nSummary:\\nInformation privacy is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, contextual information norms, and the legal and political issues surrounding them.

       " '\\n\\nTitle: Algorithmic bias\\nSummary:\\nAlgorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create \"unfair\" outcomes, such as \"privileging\" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm.\\nBias can emerge from many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect \"systematic and unfair\" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (proposed 2018) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (proposed 2021, approved 2024).\\nAs algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; by how features and labels are chosen; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software\\'s initial design.\\nAlgorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single \"algorithm\" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.',\n",

Using AI in healthcare has the potential improve predicting, diagnosing and treating diseases. Through machine learning algorithms and deep learning, AI can analyse large sets of clinical data and electronic health records and can help to diagnose the disease more quickly and precisely.\\nAI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care.\\nBecause radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.\\nAs widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and related industries. \\nUsing AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases. Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.\\n\\n',\n",

Some believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionized with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved.  There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination , harmful educational practices,  or might discourage researchers from publishing their original research openly.

       "'AI agents, defined as autonomous systems capable of performing tasks without human intervention, have been increasingly integrated into various sectors, leading to profound economic, social, and environmental impacts. Economically, AI agents enhance productivity by automating repetitive tasks, which can lead to increased output and efficiency. For instance, McKinsey estimates that AI could contribute an additional $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, significantly boosting growth in productivity and economic output (McKinsey Global Institute, 2018). However, this economic benefit comes with challenges, particularly in the labor market, where automation may displace jobs, especially in sectors like manufacturing and customer service, leading to potential unemployment and economic inequality (Bessen, 2019).  \\n\\nSocially, the integration of AI agents raises ethical concerns, such as bias in algorithmic decision-making and privacy issues related to data usage. AI systems can perpetuate existing biases if they are trained on biased datasets, resulting in unfair treatment of individuals in areas like hiring, lending, and law enforcement (O’Neil, 2016). Furthermore, the deployment of AI in surveillance technologies poses significant privacy risks, leading to societal implications regarding personal freedoms and civil liberties (Zuboff, 2019).  \\n\\nEnvironmentally, AI agents can contribute to sustainability efforts by optimizing energy consumption and resource management. For example, AI algorithms can improve efficiency in energy use in smart grids and reduce waste in supply chains, thus minimizing the carbon footprint (Wang et al., 2020). However, the environmental impact of AI development itself, particularly in terms of energy consumption in training large models, raises concerns about the carbon emissions associated with these technologies (Strubell et al., 2019). Overall, while AI agents hold the promise of substantial benefits across various dimensions, they also pose significant challenges that require careful consideration and proactive management to ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n[1]: https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/how-ai-can-deliver-real-value-to-companies\\n[2]: https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-labor-market-impacts-of-ai-automation/\\n[3]: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/564252/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/9780553418811/\\n[4]: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9781635574443\\n[5]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978919305626\\n[6]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03710.pdf'"

       "  AIMessage(content=\"AI agents are expected to have profound economic impacts across various sectors, primarily through increased productivity, job displacement, and the creation of new markets. In manufacturing, AI can streamline production processes, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. According to a McKinsey report, automation and AI could raise global productivity by 0.8 to 1.4% annually, leading to significant economic growth over time (McKinsey, 2021). In healthcare, AI agents assist in diagnostics and patient management, which can lead to cost reductions and improved patient outcomes, potentially saving the U.S. healthcare system up to $150 billion annually by 2026 (Accenture, 2017). \\n\\nMoreover, AI is projected to create new job categories even as it displaces some existing jobs. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025, AI could create 97 million new roles, particularly in fields like data analysis and AI maintenance (WEF, 2020). However, the transition may exacerbate income inequality, as workers in low-skill jobs may find it challenging to transition to new roles that require advanced skills. Education and reskilling initiatives will be crucial to mitigate this impact.\\n\\nIn the financial sector, AI agents enhance fraud detection and risk assessment, thereby reducing losses and increasing efficiency. The integration of AI tools in finance is projected to contribute up to $1 trillion in value by 2030 (PwC, 2019). Additionally, AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data can lead to more informed business decisions, driving innovation and competitive advantage across industries.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n[1]: https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-need-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work\\n[2]: https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/health/healthcare-ai\\n[3]: https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020\\n[4]: https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/ai-analysis.html\", name='subject_matter_expert'),\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='AI agents are set to significantly alter social dynamics, influencing areas such as privacy, equity, and interpersonal relationships. One major concern is the impact on privacy. AI technologies often rely on large datasets, which can include sensitive personal information. The use of AI for surveillance purposes raises ethical questions about consent and the potential for misuse of data, as highlighted by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which emphasizes the need for transparency and data protection in AI applications (EU GDPR, 2018).  \\n\\nEquity is another critical social impact of AI agents. AI systems can unintentionally perpetuate biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas like hiring, law enforcement, and lending. For instance, research demonstrates that facial recognition technology exhibits higher error rates for people of color, which can exacerbate existing social inequalities (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018). Ensuring fairness in AI systems is essential to prevent these adverse effects, and initiatives such as the AI Fairness 360 toolkit by IBM aim to address this issue (IBM, 2018).  \\n\\nFurthermore, AI agents can influence interpersonal relationships and communication patterns. The rise of AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants may alter how individuals interact with technology and each other, potentially leading to reduced face-to-face interactions and changes in social skills. Studies indicate that reliance on AI for communication can affect empathy and emotional intelligence, particularly among younger generations (Twenge et al., 2019).  \\n\\nFinally, the increasing integration of AI in daily life raises questions about dependence on technology. As individuals increasingly rely on AI for decision-making and task completion, there is a risk of diminishing critical thinking and problem-solving skills (Carr, 2010).  \\n\\nAddressing these social impacts is essential to ensure that AI technologies contribute positively to society while minimizing potential harms.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n[1]: https://gdpr.eu/\\n[2]: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287560.3287598\\n[3]: https://www.ibm.com/watson/ai-fairness-360\\n[4]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563219303102\\n[5]: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/does-technology-make-us-stupid/308156/', name='subject_matter_expert'),\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='The development and deployment of AI agents present several potential environmental impacts, particularly concerning energy consumption, resource use, and waste generation. One of the most significant concerns is the energy consumption associated with training large AI models. Research indicates that training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five cars over their lifetimes, particularly due to the extensive computational power required (Strubell et al., 2019). As AI technologies become more sophisticated, their energy demands can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, further exacerbating climate change.  \\n\\nAdditionally, the production of hardware for AI systems, such as servers and data centers, requires substantial natural resources. The mining of metals like lithium and cobalt, essential for components such as batteries and chips, can result in environmental degradation, habitat destruction, and pollution (García et al., 2020). The extraction processes often have detrimental effects on local ecosystems and communities, raising ethical concerns about sustainable sourcing practices.  \\n\\nMoreover, AI agents can contribute to e-waste, as the rapid pace of technological advancement leads to shorter product lifespans. The disposal of outdated electronic devices poses significant environmental challenges, as they may contain hazardous materials that can leach into soil and water systems (Baldé et al., 2015). Implementing more sustainable practices in the life cycle of AI technologies, including recycling and responsible disposal, is crucial to mitigating these impacts.  \\n\\nOn the positive side, AI can also play a role in environmental sustainability. For instance, AI-driven technologies can optimize energy usage in various sectors, enhance precision agriculture, and improve resource management, potentially leading to reduced environmental footprints (Rolnick et al., 2019).  \\n\\nIn summary, while the development and deployment of AI agents pose significant environmental challenges, they also offer opportunities for improving sustainability practices, necessitating a balanced approach to their integration into society.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243\\n[2]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620304015\\n[3]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213138815000575\\n[4]: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0228-0', name='subject_matter_expert'),\n",

      "[[Document(metadata={'title': 'Artificial intelligence', 'summary': 'Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and the long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'categories': ['All accuracy disputes', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles with Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy links', 'Articles with disputed statements from July 2024', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2024', 'Artificial intelligence', 'CS1: long volume value', 'Computational fields of study', 'Computational neuroscience', 'Cybernetics', 'Data science', 'Formal sciences', 'Intelligence by type', 'Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets via Module:Annotated link', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Use dmy dates from July 2023', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages'], 'page_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'image_urls': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/AI_hierarchy.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Artificial_neural_network.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Capek_play.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Dall-e_3_%28jan_%2724%29_artificial_intelligence_icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/EM_Clustering_of_Old_Faithful_data.gif', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/General_Formal_Ontology.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Global_thinking.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Gradient_descent.gif', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Kismet-IMG_6007-gradient.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Scholia_logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Shadow_Hand_Bulb_large.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/SimpleBayesNet.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Vice_President_Harris_at_the_group_photo_of_the_2023_AI_Safety_Summit.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Vincent_van_Gogh_in_watercolour.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Weakness_of_Turing_test_1.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Wikiversity_logo_2017.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/Symbol_portal_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Symbol_question.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/06/Wiktionary-logo-v2.svg'], 'related_titles': ['2001: A Space Odyssey (film)', '2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)', '2023 AI Safety Summit', '3D optical data storage', 'A* search algorithm', 'A.I.

intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and the long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\n\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Economic impact analysis', 'summary': 'An economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.

It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.\\n\\n\\n== Types of economic impacts ==\\nEconomic impact analyses often estimate multiple types of impacts.  An output impact is the total increase in business sales revenue.  In turn, local businesses use some of this new revenue to pay for goods and services outside of the study region, so the output impact is not synonymous with local business profits.  A more conservative measure of economic activity is the value added impact, which estimates the increase in the study region's gross regional product.  The gross regional product (GRP) is very similar to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), and represents the total size of the local economy.  This impact estimates the increase in local employee wages plus local business profits (not total revenue, like the output impact).  However, the value added impact may overstate local profits when they are transferred overseas (such as in the form of dividends or investments in foreign facilities).\\nAn even more conservative measure is the labour income impact, which represents the increase in total money paid to local employees in the form of salaries and wages.  The increases in income may come in the form of raises and/or increased hours for existing employees, or new jobs for the unemployed.  This is a measure of the economic impact on just personal incomes, not business revenues or profits.  A similar measure is the employment impact, which measures the increase in the number of total employees in the local region.  Instead of measuring the economic impact in terms of money, this measure presents the impact on the number of jobs in the region.\\nAnother measure of economic impact is the property value impact, measuring the increase in total property values, and is a reflection of generated income and wealth, both personal and business.\\n\\n\\n== Sources of economic impacts ==\\nIn addition to the types of impacts, economic impact analyses often estimate the sources of the impacts.  Each impact can be decomposed into different components, depending on the effect that caused the impact.  Direct effects are the results of the money initially spent in the study region by the business or organization being studied.  This includes money spent to pay for salaries, supplies, raw materials, and operating expenses.\\nThe direct effects from the initial spending creates additional activity in the local economy.  Indirect effects are the results of business-to-business transactions indirectly caused by the direct effects.  Businesses initially benefiting from the direct effects will subsequently increase spending at other local businesses.  The indirect effect is a measure of this increase in business-to-business activity (not including the initial round of spending, which is included in the direct effects).\\nInduced ef\")], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Technological singularity', 'summary': 'The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity', 'categories': ['All articles that may have off-topic sections', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from July 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017', 'Articles with unsourced statements from May 2024', 'CS1: long volume value', 'Existential risk from artificial general intelligence', 'Harv and Sfn no-target errors', 'IMDb title ID not in Wikidata', 'Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback via Module:Annotated link', 'Philosophy of artificial intelligence', 'Science fiction themes', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Singularitarianism', 'Spoken articles', 'Use dmy dates from March 2023', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2024', 'Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from May 2024', 'Wikipedia articles that may have off-topic sections from October 2021'], 'page_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity', 'image_urls': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/24_hour_Clock_symbols_icon_11.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Biological_vs._digital_information.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/En-Technological_singularity-article.opus', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/En-Technological_singularity-article.opus', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Major_Evolutionary_Transitions_digital.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Noun-technology.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/PPTMooresLawai.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Recursive_self-improvement.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg'], 'related_titles': ['2011 end times prediction', '2012 phenomenon', '2 Esdras', 'AI Magazine', 'AI alignment', 'AI box', 'AI capability control', 'AI safety', 'AI takeover', 'Abomination of desolation', 'Academic Press', 'Accelerating change', 'Al-Masih ad-Dajjal', 'Albert Hibbs', 'Alfred A.

technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.\\n\\n\\n== Intelligence explosion ==\\n\\nAlthough technological progress has been accelerating in most areas, it has been limited by the basic intelligence of the human brain, which has not, according to Paul R. Ehrlich, changed significantly for millennia. However, with the increasing power of computers and other technologies, it might eventually be possible to build a machine that is significantly more intelligent than humans.\\nIf a superhuman intelligence were to be invented—either through the amplification of human intelligence or through artificial intelligence—it would, in theory, vastly improve over human problem-solving and inventive skills. Such an AI is referred to as Seed AI because if an AI were created with engineering capabilities that matched or surpassed those of its human creators, it would have the potential to autonomously improve its own software and hardware to design an even more capable machine, which could repeat the process in turn. This recursive self-improvement could accelerate, potentially allowing enormous qualitative change before any upper limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation set in. It is speculated that over many iterations, such an AI would far surpass human cognit')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence', 'summary': 'The environmental impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) may vary significantly.

(AI) may vary significantly. Many deep learning methods have significant carbon footprints and water usage. Some scientists have suggested that artificial intelligence may provide solutions to environmental problems.\\n\\n\\n== Carbon footprint ==\\nAI has a significant carbon footprint due to growing energy usage, especially due to training and usage. Researchers have argued that the carbon footprint of AI models during training should be considered when attempting to understand the impact of AI.  One study suggested that by 2027, energy costs for AI could increase to 85–134 Twh, nearly 0.5% of all current energy usage. Training one deep learning model may use up to the same carbon footprint as the lifetime emissions of 5 cars. Training large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI generally requires much more energy compared to running a single prediction on the trained model. Using a trained model repeatedly, though, may easily multiply the energy costs of predictions. The computation required to train the most advanced AI models doubles every 3.4 months on average, leading to exponential power usage and resulting carbon footprint.\\nBERT, a generative AI model trained in 2019, consumed \"the energy of a round-trip transcontinental flight\". GPT-3 released 552 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during training, \"the equivalent of 123 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year\". Much of the energy cost is due to inefficient model architectures and processors. One model named BLOOM, from Hugging Face, trained with more efficient chips and, therefore, only released 25 metric tons of CO2. Incorporating the energy cost of manufacturing the chips for the system doubled the carbon footprint, to \"the equivalent of around 60 flights between London and New York.\" Operating BLOOM daily was estimated to release the equivalent carbon footprint as driving 54 miles.\\nAlgorithms which have lower energy costs but run millions of times a day can also have significant carbon footprints. The integration of AI into search engines could multiply energy costs significantly, with some estimates suggesting energy costs rising to nearly 30 billion kWh per year, an energy footprint larger than many countries. Another estimate found that integrating ChatGPT into every Google search query would use 10 tWh each year, the equivalent yearly energy usage of 1.5 million European Union residents.\\nAI has caused both increased water and energy usage, leading to significantly more demands on the grid. Due to increased energy demands from AI-related projects, coal-fired plants in Kansas City and West Virginia pushed back closing. Other coal-fired plants in the Salt Lake City region have pushed back retirement of their coal-fired plants by up to a decade. Environmental debates have raged in both Virginia and France about whether a \"moratorium\" should be called for additional data centers. In 2024 at the World Economic Forum, OpenAI executive Sam Altman gave a speech in which he said that the AI industry can only grow if there is a major technology breakthrough to increase energy development. \\nIn 2024, Google failed to reach key goals from their net zero plan as a result of their work with AI, and had a 48% increase in greenhouse gas emission attributable to their growth in AI. Microsoft and Meta had similar increases in their carbon footprint, similarly attributed to AI.  Carbon footprints of AI models depends on the energy source used, with data centers using renewable energy lowering their footprint. Many tech companies claim to offset energy usage by buying energy from renewable sources, though some experts argue that utilities simply replace the claimed renewable energy with increased non-renewable sources for their other customers. Analysis of the carbon footprint of AI models remains difficult to determine, as they are aggregated as part of datacenter carbon footprints, and some mode')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Automation', 'summary': \"Automation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, mainly by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation', 'categories': ['All accuracy disputes', 'All articles needing additional references', 'All articles that may contain

technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, mainly by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\n\\nIt was a preoccupation of the Greeks and Arabs (in the period between about 300 BC and about 1200 AD) to keep accurate track of time. In Ptolemaic Egypt, about 270 BC, Ctesibius described a float regulator for a water clock, a device not unlike the ball and cock in a modern flush toilet. This was the earliest feedback-controlled mechanism. The appearance of the mechanical clock in the 14th century made the water clock and its feedback control system obsolete.\\nThe Persian Banū Mūsā brothers, in their Book of Ingenious Devices (850 AD), described a number of automatic controls. Two-step level controls for fluids, a form of discontinuous variable structure controls, were developed by the Banu Musa brothers. They also described a feedback controller. The design of feedback control systems up through the Industrial Revolution was by trial-and-error, together with a great deal of engineering intuition. It was not until the mid-19th century that the stability of feedback control systems was analyzed using mathematics, the formal language of automatic control theory.\\nThe centrifugal governor was invented by Christiaan Huygens in the seventeenth century, and used to adjust the gap between millstones.\\n\\n\\n=== Industrial Revolution in Western Europe ===\\n\\nThe introduction of prime movers, or self-driven machines advanced grain mills, furnaces, boilers, and the steam engine created a new requirement for automatic control systems includi\")], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Machine learning', 'summary': \"Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.\\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.\\nThe mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. \\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning', 'categories': ['Articles with excerpts', 'Articles with short description', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'Cybernetics', 'Learning', 'Machine learning', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from January 2024'], 'page_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning', 'image_urls': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/AI_hierarchy.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/CLIPS.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Colored_neural_network.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Dall-e_3_%28jan_%2724%29_artificial_intelligence_icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Decision_Tree.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Global_thinking.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Overfitted_Data.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Regressions_sine_demo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Svm_max_sep_hyperplane_with_margin.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/Symbol_portal_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Symbol_question.svg'], 'related_titles': ['AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence', 'ACM Computing Classification System', 'ACM Computing Surveys', 'ADALINE', 'AIXI', 'AI boom', 'AI control problem', 'AI safety', 'AI takeover', 'AI winter', 'AT&T Labs', 'Action selection', 'Activation function', 'Active learning (machine learning)', 'Adaptive website', 'Adversarial machine learning', 'Affective computing', 'Agriculture', 'Alan Mackworth', 'Alan Turing', 'AlexNet', 'Alex Graves (computer scientist)', 'Algorithm', 'Algorithm design', 'Algorithmic bias', 'Algorithmic efficiency', 'Algorithmic transparency', 'AlphaFold', 'AlphaGo', 'AlphaZero', 'Amazon Machine Learning', 'Analysis of algorithms', 'Andrew Ng', 'Angoss', 'Anomaly detection', 'Anthropic', 'Apache Mahout', 'Apache Spark', 'Apache SystemML', 'Application security', 'Applications of artificial intelligence', 'Apprenticeship learning', 'Approximate computing', 'ArXiv', 'ArXiv (identifier)', 'Arithmetic coding', 'Array data structure', 'Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)', 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach', 'Artificial consciousness', 'Artificial general intelligence', 'Artificial immune system', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Artificial intelligence arms race', 'Artificial intelligence art', 'Artificial intelligence in government', 'Artificial intelligence in healthcare', 'Artificial intelligence in industry', 'Artificial intelligence in mental health', 'Artificial intelligence systems integration', 'Artificial neural network', 'Artificial neuron', 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'Association rule learning', 'Astroinformatics', 'Attention (machine learning)', 'Auto-GPT', 'Autoencoder', 'Automata theory', 'Automated decision-making', 'Automated machine learning', 'Automated medical diagnosis', 'Automated planning and scheduling', 'Automated theorem proving', 'Automatic differentiation', 'Autonomous car', 'Autoregressive model', 'Azure Machine Learning', 'BERT (language model)', 'BIRCH', 'BLOOM (language model)', 'Backdoor (computing)', 'Backpropagation', 'Bank fraud', 'Banking', 'Bard (chatbot)', 'Basic Books', 'Basis function', 'Batch learning', 'Batch normalization', 'Bayesian inference', 'Bayesian network', 'Bayesian optimization', 'Behaviorism', 'Bias–variance decomposition', 'Bias–variance tradeoff', 'Bibcode (identifier)', 'Big data', 'Binary classifier', 'Bing Chat', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological neural network', 'Biology', 'Black box', 'Boltzmann machine', 'Boosting (machine learning)', 'Bootstrap aggregating', 'Bootstrapping (statistics)', 'Brain', 'Brain–computer interface', 'CURE algorithm', 'Caffe (software)', 'Canadians', 'Canonical correlation', 'Carla Brodley', 'Centroid', 'Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)', 'ChatGPT', 'Chatbot', 'Chemical synapse', 'Cheminformatics', 'Chinchilla AI', 'Chinese room', 'Christopher Bishop', 'Christopher M.

study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.\\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field\\'s methods.\\nThe mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. \\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.\\nAlthough the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb\\'s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.\\nBy the early 1960s an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.\\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing\\'s proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".\\nModern-day machine learning has two objectives.  One is to classify data based on model')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Ethics of artificial intelligence', 'summary': 'The ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within the field that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. This includes algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. \\nIt also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks. \\nSome application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence', 'categories': ['All accuracy disputes', 'All articles lacking reliable references', 'All articles with failed verification', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles lacking reliable references from January 2024', 'Articles with Russian-language sources (ru)', 'Articles with disputed statements from April 2024', 'Articles with failed verification from November 2020', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2024', 'Ethics of science and technology', 'Philosophy of artificial intelligence', 'Regulation of robots', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Webarchive template wayback links'], 'page_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence', 'image_urls': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Dall-e_3_%28jan_%2724%29_artificial_intelligence_icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Hospital_delivery_robot_having_priority_to_elevators.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Kamala_Harris_speaks_about_racial_bias_in_artificial_intelligence_-_2020-04-23.ogv', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Kamala_Harris_speaks_about_racial_bias_in_artificial_intelligence_-_2020-04-23.ogv', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg'], 'related_titles': ['2001: A Space Odyssey (film)', 'A.I.

topics within the field that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. This includes algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. \\nIt also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks. \\nSome application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military.\\n\\n\\n== Machine ethics ==\\n\\nMachine ethics (or machine morality) is the field of research concerned with designing Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), robots or artificially intelligent computers that behave morally or as though moral. To account for the nature of these agents, it has been suggested to consider certain philosophical ideas, like the standard characterizations of agency, rational agency, moral agency, and artificial agency, which are related to the concept of AMAs.\\nThere are discussions on creating tests to see if an AI is capable of making ethical decisions. Alan Winfield concludes that the Turing test is flawed and the requirement for an AI to pass the test is too low. A proposed alternative test is one called the Ethical Turing Test, which would improve on the current test by having multiple judges decide if the AI\\'s decision is ethical or unethical. Neuromorphic AI could be one way to create morally capable robots, as it aims to process information similarly to humans, nonlinearly and with millions of interconnected artificial neurons. Similarly, whole-brain emulation (scanning a brain and simulating it on digital hardware) could also in principle lead to human-like robots, thus capable of moral actions. And large language models are capable of approximating human moral judgments. Inevitably, this raises the question of the environment in which such robots would learn about the world and whose morality they would inherit – or if they end up developing human \\'weaknesses\\' as well: selfishness, pro-survival attitudes, inconsistency, scale insensitivity, etc.\\nIn Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong, Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that attempts to teach robots right from wrong will likely advance understanding of human ethics by motivating humans to address gaps in modern normative theory and by providing a platform for experimental investigation. As one example, it has introduced normative ethicists to the controversial issue of which specific learning algorithms to use in machines. For simple decisions, Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky have argued that decision trees (such as ID3) are more transparent than neural networks and genetic algorithms, while Chris Santos-Lang argued in favor of machine learning on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable to criminal \"hackers\".\\n\\n\\n=== Robot ethics ===\\n\\nThe term \"robot ethics\" (sometimes \"roboethics\") refers to the morality of how humans design, construct, use and treat robots. Robot ethics intersect with the ethics of AI. Robots are physical machines whereas AI can be only software. Not all robots function through AI systems and not all AI systems are robots. Robot ethics considers how machines may be used to harm or benefit humans, their impact on individual autonomy, and their effects on social justice.\\n\\n\\n=== Ethical principles ===\\nIn the review of 84 ethics guidelines for AI, 11 clusters of principles were found: transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility, privacy, beneficence, freedom and autonomy, tr')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'AI takeover', 'summary': 'An AI takeover is an imagined scenario in which artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as the dominant form of intelligence on Earth and computer programs or robots effectively take control of the planet away from the human species, which relies on human intelligence.

computer programs or robots effectively take control of the planet away from the human species, which relies on human intelligence. Stories of AI takeovers remain popular throughout science fiction, but recent advancements have made the threat more real. Possible scenarios include replacement of the entire human workforce due to automation, takeover by a superintelligent AI (ASI), and the notion of a robot uprising. Some public figures, such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, have advocated research into precautionary measures to ensure future superintelligent machines remain under human control.\\n\\n\\n== Types ==\\n\\n\\n=== Automation of the economy ===\\n\\nThe traditional consensus among economists has been that technological progress does not cause long-term unemployment. However, recent innovation in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence has raised worries that human labor will become obsolete, leaving people in various sectors without jobs to earn a living, leading to an economic crisis. Many small and medium size businesses may also be driven out of business if they cannot afford or licence the latest robotic and AI technology, and may need to focus on areas or services that cannot easily be replaced for continued viability in the face of such technology.\\n\\n\\n==== Technologies that may displace workers ====\\nAI technologies have been widely adopted in recent years. While these technologies have replaced some traditional workers, they also create new opportunities. Industries that are most susceptible to AI takeover include transportation, retail, and military. AI military technologies, for example, allow soldiers to work remotely without risk of injury. A study in 2024 highlights AI's ability to perform routine and repetitive tasks poses significant risks of job displacement, especially in sectors like manufacturing and administrative support. Author Dave Bond argues that as AI technologies continue to develop and expand, the relationship between humans and robots will change; they will become closely integrated in several aspects of life. AI will likely displace some workers while creating opportunities for new jobs in other sectors, especially in fields where tasks are repeatable.\\n\\n\\n==== Computer-integrated manufacturing ====\\n\\nComputer-integrated manufacturing uses computers to control the production process. This allows individual processes to exchange information with each other and initiate actions. Although manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone by the integration of computers, the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries.\\n\\n\\n==== White-collar machines ====\\n\\nThe 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research, and journalism. Care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, have also begun to be performed by robots.\\n\\n\\n==== Autonomous cars ====\\nAn autonomous car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Many such vehicles are being developed, but as of May 2017, automated cars permitted on public roads are not yet fully autonomous. They all require a human driver at the wheel who at a moment's notice can take control of the vehicle. Among the obstacles to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles are concerns about the resulting loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry. On March 18, 2018, the first human was killed by an autonomous vehicle in Tempe, Arizona by an Uber self-driving car.\\n\\n\\n==== AI-generated content ====\\n\\nThe use of automated content has become relevant since the technological advancements in artificial intelligence models such as ChatGP\")], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Digital economy', 'summary': 'The digital economy is a portmanteau of digital computing and economy, and is an umbrella term that describes how traditional brick-and-mortar economic activities (production, distribution, trade) are being transformed by the Internet and World Wide Web technologies.\\nThe digital economy is backed by the spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) across all business sectors to enhance productivity.

For example, many academic papers were published by New York University’s Center for Digital Economy Research. The term was the title of Don Tapscott\\'s 1995 book, The Digital Economy: Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence.\\nAccording to Thomas Mesenbourg (2001), three main components of the digital economy concept can be identified:\\n\\nE-business infrastructure (hardware, software, telecom, networks, human capital, etc.),\\nE-business (how business is conducted, any process that an organization conducts over computer-mediated networks),\\nE-commerce (transfer of goods, for example when a book is sold online).\\nBill Imlah states that new applications are blurring these boundaries and adding complexity, for example, social media and Internet search.\\nIn the last decade of the 20th century, Nicholas Negroponte (1995) used a metaphor of shifting from processing atoms to processing bits: \"The problem is simple. When information is embodied in atoms, there is a need for all sorts of industrial-age means and huge corporations for delivery. But suddenly, when the focus shifts to bits, the traditional big guys are no longer needed. Do-it-yourself publishing on the Internet makes sense. It does not for a paper copy.\"\\nThe digital economy is variously known as the Internet Economy, Web Economy, Cryptoeconomy, and New Economy. Since the digital economy is continuously replacing and expanding the traditional economy, there is no clear delineation between the two integrated economy types. The digital economy results from billions of daily online transactions (data exchanges) among people, organizations (businesses, educational institutions, non-profits), and distributed computing devices (servers, laptops, smartphones, etc.) enabled by Internet, World Wide Web, and blockchain technologies.\\n\\n\\n== Development of the concept ==\\nThere are varied definitions of the digital economy. There are multiple similar concepts for broadly the same phenomenon. According to the OECD, the Digital Economy can be defined in three different approaches:\\n\\nBottom-up approach: characterizing industries’ and firms‘ output or production processes to decide whether they shou')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Cognition AI', 'summary': 'Cognition AI, Inc.

The company developed Devin AI, an AI software developer.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nCognition was founded in November 2023 by Scott Wu, Walden Yan, and Steven Hao. All three were competitive programmers who won gold medals at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).\\nOriginally the company was focused on cryptocurrency before moving to AI as it became a trend in Silicon Valley following the release of ChatGPT. \\nIn March 2024, Cognition released a demo of its AI coding tool, Devin AI which was said to be able to perform the tasks of a software engineer.\\nCognition boasted that its 10-person team as of March 2024 has won a total of 10 IOI gold medals. Apart from its founders, other members of the team who are gold medalists include Wu's brother Neal and Andrew He. Wu stated this background gives Cognition an edge in AI competition as teaching an AI to be a programmer is a very deep algorithmic problem that requires the system to make complex decisions.\\nWith regards to fundraising, the company was backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund which provided $21 million of funding to it in early 2024 valuing the company at $350 million. In April 2024, Founders Fund led a $175 million investment into Cognition valuing the company at $2 billion making it a Unicorn.\\nIn May 2024, it was announced that Cognition partnered with Microsoft to integrate Devin AI and would be powered Microsoft Azure.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and the long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'categories': ['All accuracy disputes', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles with Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy links', 'Articles with disputed statements from July 2024', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2024', 'Artificial intelligence', 'CS1: long volume value', 'Computational fields of study', 'Computational neuroscience', 'Cybernetics', 'Data science', 'Formal sciences', 'Intelligence by type', 'Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets via Module:Annotated link', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Use dmy dates from July 2023', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages'], 'page_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'image_urls': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/AI_hierarchy.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Artificial_neural_network.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Capek_play.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Dall-e_3_%28jan_%2724%29_artificial_intelligence_icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/EM_Clustering_of_Old_Faithful_data.gif', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/General_Formal_Ontology.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Global_thinking.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Gradient_descent.gif', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Kismet-IMG_6007-gradient.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Scholia_logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Shadow_Hand_Bulb_large.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/SimpleBayesNet.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Vice_President_Harris_at_the_group_photo_of_the_2023_AI_Safety_Summit.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Vincent_van_Gogh_in_watercolour.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Weakness_of_Turing_test_1.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Wikiversity_logo_2017.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/Symbol_portal_class.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Symbol_question.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/06/Wiktionary-logo-v2.svg'], 'related_titles': ['2001: A Space Odyssey (film)', '2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)', '2023 AI Safety Summit', '3D optical data storage', 'A* search algorithm', 'A.I.

intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and the long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\n\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Artificial intelligence in healthcare', 'summary': 'Artificial intelligence in healthcare is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and understanding of complex medical and health care data. It can also augment and exceed human capabilities by providing faster or new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Using AI in healthcare has the potential improve predicting, diagnosing and treating diseases. Through machine learning algorithms and deep learning, AI can analyse large sets of clinical data and electronic health records and can help to diagnose the disease more quickly and precisely.\\nAI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care.\\nBecause radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.\\nAs widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and related industries. \\nUsing AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases. Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.\\n\\n', 'source':

understanding of complex medical and health care data. It can also augment and exceed human capabilities by providing faster or new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Using AI in healthcare has the potential improve predicting, diagnosing and treating diseases. Through machine learning algorithms and deep learning, AI can analyse large sets of clinical data and electronic health records and can help to diagnose the disease more quickly and precisely.\\nAI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care.\\nBecause radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.\\nAs widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and related industries. \\nUsing AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases. Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.\\n\\n\\n== Applications in healthcare systems ==\\n\\n\\n=== Disease diagnosis ===\\nAccurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognising medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analyis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias, by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. \\nDoctors' decision making could also be supported by AI in urgent situations, for example in the emergency department. Here AI algorithms can help prioritise more serious cases and reduce waiting time. Decision support systems augmented with AI can offer real-time suggestions and faster data interpretation to aid the decisions made by healthcare professionals.\\nA 2023 study in JAMA reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT-generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit’s r/AskDocs.  Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship.\\nRecent developments in statistical physics, machine learning, and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches.\\n\\n\\n=== Electronic health records ===\\nElectronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, the next step is to use artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians.\\nOne application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the over based on personal preferences. NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. Other applications use concept p\")], [Document(metadata={'title': 'AI in education', 'summary': 'Artificial intelligence or Ai is a broad “skewer” term that has specific areas of study clustered next to it, including machine learning, natural language processing, the philosophy of artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and TESCREAL. Research about AI in higher education is widespread in the global north, where there is much hype from venture capital, big tech and some open educationalists. Some believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionized with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved.  There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination , harmful educational practices,  or might discourage researchers from publishing their original research openly.  Worries about AI safety risks such as privacy breaches, algorithmic biases, security concerns, ethics, and compliance barriers are accompanied by other doomsday warnings. Generative AI tools are using a data ecosystem built by open-source movements, yet often ignore the accompanying expectations of reciprocity and reasonable use, says Sylvie Delacroix, a digital-law scholar at King’s College London. The tools also risk polluting the Internet with AI-generated content of dubious quality. By failing to redirect users to the human-made sources on which they were built, LLMs could disincentivize original creation. Without putting more power into the hands of creators, the system will come under severe strain. Regulators and companies must act.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_in_education', 'categories': ['Applications of artificial intelligence', 'Articles with short description',

broad “skewer” term that has specific areas of study clustered next to it, including machine learning, natural language processing, the philosophy of artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and TESCREAL. Research about AI in higher education is widespread in the global north, where there is much hype from venture capital, big tech and some open educationalists. Some believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionized with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved.  There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination , harmful educational practices,  or might discourage researchers from publishing their original research openly.  Worries about AI safety risks such as privacy breaches, algorithmic biases, security concerns, ethics, and compliance barriers are accompanied by other doomsday warnings. Generative AI tools are using a data ecosystem built by open-source movements, yet often ignore the accompanying expectations of reciprocity and reasonable use, says Sylvie Delacroix, a digital-law scholar at King’s College London. The tools also risk polluting the Internet with AI-generated content of dubious quality. By failing to redirect users to the human-made sources on which they were built, LLMs could disincentivize original creation. Without putting more power into the hands of creators, the system will come under severe strain. Regulators and companies must act.\\n\\n\\n== Different Perspectives on Ai in Education ==\\nEducational technology can be a powerful and effective assistant for learning. Computer companies are constantly updating their technology products. Some educationalists have suggested that Ai might automate procedural knowledge and expertise or even match or surpass human capacities on cognitive tasks. They advocate for the integration of AI across the curriculum and the development of AI Literacy. Others are more skeptical as Ai faces an ethical challenge, where \"fabricated responses\" or \"inaccurate information\", politely referred to as “hallucinations”  are generated and presented as fact. Some remain curious about societies tendency to put their faith in engineering achievements, and the systems of power and privilege that leads towards determinist thinking.  While others see copyright infringement or the introduction of harm, division and other social impacts, and advocate resistance to Ai.  Evidence is mounting that Ai written assessments are undetectable, which poses serious questions about the academic integrity of university assessments. \\n\\n\\n== Tokens, Text and Hallucinations ==\\nTranslation, summarization, information retrieval, conversational interactions are some of the complex language tasks that machines are expected to handle.Large language models (LLMs) use natural language processing to generate coherent text. Ai models, trained by billions of words and code that has been web-scraped. LLMS are feats of engineering, that see text as tokens. The relationships between tokens, allows LLM  to predict the next word, and then the next, thus generating a meaningful sentence and the appearance of thought and interactions.  LLM are often dependent on a huge text corpus that is normally extracted from the World Wide Web. This dataset ')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Artificial intelligence art', 'summary': 'Artificial intelligence art is visual artwork created through the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) program.   \\nArtists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human–AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, artists have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.\\nThe increased availability of AI art tools to the general public in the 2020s AI boom provided opportunities for creating AI generated images outside of academia and professional artists. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.\\n\\n',

'sections': []}, page_content=\"Artificial intelligence art is visual artwork created through the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) program.   \\nArtists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human–AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, artists have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.\\nThe increased availability of AI art tools to the general public in the 2020s AI boom provided opportunities for creating AI generated images outside of academia and professional artists. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\n\\nThe concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automatons has flourished throughout history, such as Maillardet's automaton, created around 1800.\\nThe academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Since its founding, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.\\n\\n\\n=== 1950s to 2000s: Early implementations ===\\n\\nSince the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. These works were sometimes referred to as algorithmic art, computer art, digital art, or new media.\\nOne of the first significant AI art systems was AARON, developed by Harold Cohen beginning in the late 1960s at the University of California at San Diego. AARON uses a symbolic rule-based approach to generate technical images in the era of GOFAI programming. Cohen developed AARON with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. In its earliest form, AARON created abstract black-and-white drawings. Cohen would later finish the drawings by painting them. Throughout the years, he also began to develop a way for AARON to also paint, using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen. AARON was exhibited in 1972 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. From 1973 to 1975, Cohen refined AARON during a residency at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University. in 2024, the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited AI art from throughout Cohen's career, including re-created versions of his early robotic drawing machines.\\nKarl Sims has exhibited art created with artificial life since the 1980s. He received an M.S. in computer graphics from the MIT Media Lab in 1987. Sims was artist-in-residence from 1990 to 1996 at the supercomputer manufacturer and artificial intelligence company Thinking Machines. In both 1991 and 1992, Sims won the Golden Nica award at Prix Ars Electronica for his 3D AI animated videos using artificial evolution. In 1997, Sims created the interactive installation Galápagos for the NTT InterCommunication Center in Tokyo. In this installation, viewers help evolve 3D animated creatures by selecting which ones will be allowed to live and produce new, mutated offspring. Sims received an Emmy Award in 2019 for outstanding achievement in engineering development.\\nEric Millikin has been creating animated films using artificial intelligence since the 1980s, and began p\")], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Regulation of artificial intelligence', 'summary': 'Regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI). It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD. \\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology.

promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI). It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD. \\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks. \\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks. \\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nAccording to Stanford University\\'s 2023 AI Index, the annual number of bills mentioning \"artificial intelligence\" passed in 127 surveyed countries jumped from one in 2016 to 37 in 2022.\\nIn 2017, Elon Musk called for regulation of AI development. According to NPR, the Tesla CEO was \"clearly not thrilled\" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believed the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: \"Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there\\'s a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization.\" In response, some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that is still in development. Responding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has argued that AI is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology. Many tech companies oppose the harsh regulation of AI and \"While some of the companies have said they welcome rules around A.I., they have also argued against tough regulations akin to those being created in Europe\"  Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself, some scholars suggested developing common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty.\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".\\n\\n\\n== Perspectives ==\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligences is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI. Regulation is now generally considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks. Public administration and policy considerations generally focus on the technical and economic implications and on trustworthy and human-centered AI systems, although regulation of artificial superintelligences is also considered. The basic approach to regulation focuses on the risks and biases of machine-learning algorithms, at the level of the input data, algorithm testing, and decision model. It also focuses on the explainability of the outputs.\\nThere have been both hard law and soft law proposals to regulate AI. Some legal scholars have noted that hard law approaches to AI regulation have substantial challenges. Among the challenges, AI technology i')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'AI safety', 'summary': 'AI safety is an interdisciplinary field focused on preventing accidents, misuse, or other harmful consequences arising from artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It encompasses machine ethics and AI alignment, which aim to ensure AI systems are moral and beneficial, as well as monitoring AI systems for risks and enhancing their reliability. The field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced AI models.\\nBeyond technical research, AI safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. It gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in generative AI and public concerns voiced by researchers and CEOs about potential dangers. During the 2023 AI Safety Summit, the United States and the United Kingdom both established their own AI Safety Institute. However, researchers have expressed concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety', 'categories': ['AI safety', 'All articles lacking reliable references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles lacking reliable references from July 2023', 'Articles with excerpts', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2024', 'Artificial intelligence', 'CS1: long volume value', 'CS1 errors: missing periodical', 'CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of January 2024', 'CS1 maint: location missing publisher', 'Cybernetics', 'Existential risk from artificial general intelligence', 'Short description is different from Wikidata'], 'page_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety', 'image_urls': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Dall-e_3_%28jan_%2724%29_artificial_intelligence_icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Illustration_of_imperceptible_adversarial_pertubation.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Power-Seeking_Image.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Vice_President_Harris_at_the_group_photo_of_the_2023_AI_Safety_Summit.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg'], 'related_titles': ['AI Safety Institute', 'AI Safety Summit', 'AI Seoul Summit', 'AI alignment', 'AI boom', 'AI capability control', 'AI control problem', 'AI takeover', 'AI winter', 'Adversarial machine learning', 'Algorithmic bias', 'Alignment Research Center', 'Andrew Ng', 'Anomaly detection', 'Applications of artificial intelligence', 'ArXiv (identifier)', 'Ari Holtzman', 'Artificial Intelligence Act', 'Artificial consciousness', 'Artificial general intelligence', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Artificial intelligence arms race', 'Artificial intelligence art', 'Artificial intelligence detection software', 'Artificial intelligence in government', 'Artificial intelligence in healthcare', 'Artificial intelligence in industry', 'Artificial intelligence in mental health', 'Artificial intelligence systems integration', 'Artificial superintelligence', 'Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI', 'Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated planning and scheduling', 'Autonomous vehicles', 'Bayesian network', 'Bibcode (identifier)', 'Bill Gates', 'Bill Joy', 'Bioterrorism', 'Black box', 'Center for AI Safety', 'Center for Applied Rationality', 'Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence', 'Centre for the Study of Existential Risk', 'Chinese room', 'Computer vision', 'Consequentialism', 'Credit score', 'Critical system', 'Cuban Missile Crisis', 'Cyberattack', 'DARPA', 'Dan Hendrycks', 'Deep learning', 'Deepfake', 'Department for Science, Innovation and Technology', 'Do You Trust This Computer?', 'Doi (identifier)', 'Domain adaptation', 'Effective accelerationism', 'EleutherAI', 'Eliezer Yudkowsky', 'Elon Musk', 'Ethics of artificial intelligence', 'Evolutionary algorithm', 'Existential risk from artificial general intelligence', 'Explainability', 'Explainable artificial intelligence', 'Fairness (machine learning)', 'Formal verification', 'Frank Wilczek', 'Friendly artificial intelligence', 'Future of Humanity Institute', 'Future of Life Institute', 'Game theory', 'General game playing', 'Generative AI', 'Generative artificial intelligence', 'Generative audio', 'Geoffrey Hinton', 'Gina Raimondo', 'Glossary of artificial intelligence', 'Google DeepMind', 'Hdl (identifier)', 'History of artificial intelligence', 'Human Compatible', 'Human extinction', 'Humanity+', 'Huw Price', 'Hybrid intelligent system', 'ISBN (identifier)', 'ISSN (identifier)', 'Information Age', 'Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies', 'Instrumental convergence', 'Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity', 'Intelligence explosion', 'Intelligent agent', 'Jaan Tallinn', 'John Markoff', 'K.

other harmful consequences arising from artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It encompasses machine ethics and AI alignment, which aim to ensure AI systems are moral and beneficial, as well as monitoring AI systems for risks and enhancing their reliability. The field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced AI models.\\nBeyond technical research, AI safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. It gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in generative AI and public concerns voiced by researchers and CEOs about potential dangers. During the 2023 AI Safety Summit, the United States and the United Kingdom both established their own AI Safety Institute. However, researchers have expressed concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities.\\n\\n\\n== Motivations ==\\nScholars discuss current risks from critical systems failures, bias, and AI-enabled surveillance, as well as emerging risks like technological unemployment, digital manipulation, weaponization, AI-enabled cyberattacks and bioterrorism. They also discuss speculative risks from losing control of future artificial general intelligence (AGI) agents, or from AI enabling perpetually stable dictatorships.\\n\\n\\n=== Existential safety ===\\n\\nSome have criticized concerns about AGI, such as Andrew Ng who compared them in 2015 to \"worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet\". Stuart J. Russell on the other side urges caution, arguing that \"it is better to anticipate human ingenuity than to underestimate it\".\\nAI researchers have widely differing opinions about the severity and primary sources of risk posed by AI technology – though surveys suggest that experts take high consequence risks seriously. In two surveys of AI researchers, the median respondent was optimistic about AI overall, but placed a 5% probability on an \"extremely bad (e.g. human extinction)\" outcome of advanced AI. In a 2022 survey of the natural language processing community, 37% agreed or weakly agreed that it is plausible that AI decisions could lead to a catastrophe that is \"at least as bad as an all-out nuclear war\".\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nRisks from AI began to be seriously discussed at the start of the computer age:\\n\\nMoreover, if we move in the direction of making machines which learn and whose behavior is modified by experience, we must face the fact that every degree of independence we give the machine is a degree of possible defiance of our wishes.\\nFrom 2008 to 2009, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) commissioned a study to explore and address potential long-term societal influences of AI research and development. The panel was generally skeptical of the radical views expressed by science-fiction authors but agreed that \"additional research would be valuable on methods for understanding and verifying the range of behaviors of complex computational systems to minimize unexpected outcomes\".\\nIn 2011, Roman Yampolskiy introduced the term \"AI safety engineering\" at the Philosophy and Theory of Artificial Intelligence conference, listing prior failures of AI systems and arguing that \"the frequency and seriousness of such events will steadily increase as AIs become more capable\".\\nIn 2014, philosopher Nick Bostrom published the book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. He has the opinion that the rise of AGI has the potential to create various societal issues, ranging from the displacement of the workforce by AI, manipulation of political and military structures, to even the possibility of human extinction. His argument that future advanced systems may pose a threat to human existence prompted Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking to voice similar concerns.\\nIn 2015, dozens of artificial intelligence experts signed an open letter on artificial int')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Smart city', 'summary': 'A smart city is an urban area that has been developed with a high level of technological advancement, utilising a variety of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data. This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city', 'categories': ['All articles needing copy edit', 'All

to collect specific data. This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nHistorically, cities have functioned as centers of innovation, and the advent of the digital era has presented new opportunities and challenges for urban development. As a result, cities are transitioning into \"smart cities\" with the aim of creating urban environments that are more efficient, sustainable, and livable.\\nThis transformation involves the implementation of various technological solutions and data-driven approaches to urban management. The shift to smart cities has implications that extend beyond the urban sphere, encompassing significant social, cultural, and economic impacts. The process necessitates a comprehensive restructuring of both internal and external city management and operations, leading to a reevaluation of urban governance models, approaches to citizen participation, and methods of public service delivery.\\nThe smart city concept emphasizes the importance of collaboration between various stakeholders, including governmental bodies, private enterprises, and citizens, to jointly develop innovative solutions and address complex urban challenges. By adopting this approach, cities seek to not only upgrade their infrastructure and service delivery but also to promote social inclusion, technological adoption, and economic development. The utilization of digital technologies enables the improvement of residents\\' quality of life, the advancement of sustainability practices, and the stimulation of economic growth through the creation of new industries and ')], [Document(metadata={'title': 'Regulation of artificial intelligence', 'summary': 'Regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI). It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD. \\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks. \\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks. \\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_artificial_intelligence', 'categories': ['All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles needing additional references', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from July 2023', 'Articles needing additional references from October 2023', 'Articles with excerpts', 'Articles with imported Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 text', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'Computer law', 'Existential risk from artificial general intelligence', 'Politics and technology', 'Regulation of artificial intelligence', 'Regulation of technologies', 'Short description is different from Wikidata'], 'page_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_artificial_intelligence', 'image_urls': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/AI_Strategic_Documents_Timeline_UNICRI.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Agreement_with_security_statements_-_2024_AI_index.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Creative_Commons_by_small.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Number_of_AI-related_regulations_in_the_US_-_2024_AI_index.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg'], 'related_titles': ['AI Index', 'AI Safety Institute', 'AI Safety Summit', 'AI alignment', 'AI control problem', 'AI ethics', 'AI safety', 'Adobe Inc.', 'Alan Turing Institute', 'Algorithmic accountability', 'Amazon (company)', 'Anthropic', 'ArXiv (identifier)', 'Artificial Intelligence Act', 'Artificial general intelligence', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Artificial intelligence arms race', 'Artificial intelligence in government', 'Artificial intelligence industry in China', 'Audio deepfake', 'Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'Australian Computer Society', 'Australian Industry Group', 'Bibcode (identifier)', 'Bill (law)', 'Biometrics', 'Brain–computer interface', 'Brian Krzanich', 'Business Council of Australia', 'Campaign to Stop Killer Robots', 'Caucus', 'Center for Security and Emerging Technology', 'Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party', 'ChatGPT', 'Climate change mitigation', 'Cohere', 'Commission on Elections (Philippines)', 'Computer trespass', 'Congressional Research Service', 'Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons', 'Copyleft', 'Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing', 'Council of Europe', 'Council of Ministers (Spain)', 'Council of Small Business Organisations Australia', 'Creative Commons license', 'DIN', 'Daniel P.

promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI). It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD. \\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks. \\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks. \\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nAccording to Stanford University\\'s 2023 AI Index, the annual number of bills mentioning \"artificial intelligence\" passed in 127 surveyed countries jumped from one in 2016 to 37 in 2022.\\nIn 2017, Elon Musk called for regulation of AI development. According to NPR, the Tesla CEO was \"clearly not thrilled\" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believed the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: \"Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there\\'s a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization.\" In response, some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that is still in development. Responding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has argued that AI is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology. Many tech companies oppose the harsh regulation of AI and \"While some of the companies have said they welcome rules around A.I., they have also argued against tough regulations akin to those being created in Europe\"  Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself, some scholars suggested developing common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty.\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".\\n\\n\\n== Perspectives ==\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligences is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI. Regulation is now generally considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks. Public administration and policy considerations generally focus on the technical and economic implications and on trustworthy and human-centered AI systems, although regulation of artificial superintelligences is also considered. The basic approach to regulation focuses on the risks and biases of machine-learning algorithms, at the level of the input data, algorithm testing, and decision model. It also focuses on the explainability of the outputs.\\nThere have been both hard law and soft law proposals to regulate AI. Some legal scholars have noted that hard law approaches to AI regulation have substantial challenges.

The book focuses on von Neumann, but is also about physicist Paul Ehrenfest, history of artificial intelligence, and Lee Sedol\\'s Go match against AlphaGo. The book received mostly positive reviews from critics.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nJohn von Neumann was a Jewish Hungarian-born polymath who was a prodigy from an early childhood. Von Neumann worked in multiple fields of science, theoretical like mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, game theory, cellular automata, and applied like nuclear weapons research during the Manhattan Project in the World War II, computer architecture later called after him, and many others. Labatut calls him \"the smartest human being of the 20th century\". The title of the book is derived from an early computer based on von Neumann architecture, built after the war at Los Alamos laboratory, called MANIAC I.\\nBenjamín Labatut is a Chilean author, known before for his earlier book When We Cease to Understand the World, published in 2020. It is a collection of fictionalised stories about several famous scientists, that received positive reviews and was translated into multiple languages from original Spanish.\\nThe MANIAC is Labatut\\'s first book written in English. In an interview, Labatut admitted that he prefers to write in English:\\n\\nEnglish is my preferred form of thought. ... English is the language I do most if not all my reading. And it is a far better language than Spanish, in so many ways. Writing \"clean\" prose in Spanish is almost impossible, because so many of its sounds clash. Borges said that he found English \"a far finer language than Spanish\" because it\\'s both Germanic and Latin; because of its wonderful vocabulary (\"Regal is not exactly the same thing as saying kingly,\" he explained); because of its physicality; and because you can do almost anything with verbs and prepositions.\\n\\nLabatut was inspired to write The MANIAC by George Dyson\\'s book Turing\\'s Cathedral.\\n\\n\\n== Synopsis ==\\nThe book has three chapters. The first chapter \"Paul or the Discovery of the Irrational\", written in the third person, is about physicist Paul Ehrenfest. The chapter opens with Ehrenfest shooting his son Vassily, who suffered from Down syndrome, and then himself dead. It then recounts Ehrenfest\\'s life story, describing his relationships with his wife Tatyana, his mistress Nelly Meyjes, and his eminent physicist colleagues. It chronicles his descent into despair and depression over disintegration of his marriage, the advent of quantum mechanics within physics, and the direction that Europe was heading in with the rise of the Nazi Party to power in Germany, looping back to the initial scene of the chapter.\\n\\nThe second chapter, \"John or the Mad Dreams of Reason\", is about John von Neumann, written like a series of interviews of his family members, wives, friends, and colleagues, each in a distinctive voice. It is divided into three parts. Part I, \"The Limits of Logic\", is about his early life, as told by von Neumann\\'s childhood friend Eugene Wigner, mother Margrit Kann, brother Nicholas von Neumann, first wife Mariette Kövesi, and scientists Theodore von Karman, George Polya, and Gábor Szegő. It climaxes with von Neumann\\'s participation in David Hilbert\\'s program to create a logical basis for mathematics based on a consistent set of axioms, a quest that was ultimately scuppered by Kurt Gödel.\\nPart II, \"The Delicate Balance of Terror\", discusses von Neumann\\'s role in the Manhattan Project (as told by Richard Feynman); his development of game theory and the doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD) (as told by Oskar Morgenstern); and his creation of the MANIAC I computer and the von Neumann architecture (as told by Julian Bigelow).\\nIn Part III, \"Ghosts in the Machine\", Sydney Brenner discusses von Neumann\\'s c')]]\n"

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and the long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n\\nCategories: All accuracy disputes, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles with Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy links, Articles with disputed statements from July 2024, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from June 2024, Artificial intelligence, CS1: long volume value, Computational fields of study, Computational neuroscience, Cybernetics, Data science, Formal sciences, Intelligence by type, Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets via Module:Annotated link, Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata, Short description is different from Wikidata, Use dmy dates from July 2023, Webarchive template wayback links, Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages', '\\n\\nTitle: Economic impact analysis\\nSummary:\\nAn economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.\\nCategories: Articles with excerpts, Articles with short description, CS1 errors: missing periodical, Economics, Evaluation methods, Short description matches Wikidata, Webarchive template wayback links', '\\n\\nTitle: Technological singularity\\nSummary:\\nThe technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.\\nCategories: All articles that may have off-topic sections, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles with hAudio microformats, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from April 2018, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2012, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017, Articles with unsourced statements from May 2024, CS1: long volume value, Existential risk from artificial general intelligence, Harv and Sfn no-target errors, IMDb title ID not in Wikidata, Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback via Module:Annotated link, Philosophy of artificial intelligence, Science fiction themes, Short description is different from Wikidata, Singularitarianism, Spoken articles, Use dmy dates from March 2023, Webarchive template wayback links, Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2024, Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from May 2024, Wikipedia articles that may have off-topic sections from October 2021', '\\n\\nTitle: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nThe environmental impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) may vary significantly.

Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\\nCategories: All accuracy disputes, All articles needing additional references, All articles that may contain original research, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles containing video clips, Articles needing additional references from May 2019, Articles that may contain original research from March 2018, Articles with disputed statements from October 2013, Articles with excerpts, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from June 2024, Articles with unsourced statements from May 2021, Articles with unsourced statements from October 2013, Articles with unsourced statements from September 2017, Automation, CS1 French-language sources (fr), CS1 German-language sources (de), CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of July 2024, Free-content attribution, Free content from FAO, Pages using Sister project links with default search, Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch, Short description is different from Wikidata, Use dmy dates from July 2020, Webarchive template wayback links, Wikipedia further reading cleanup, Wikipedia spam cleanup from March 2023\", \"\\n\\nTitle: Machine learning\\nSummary:\\nMachine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.

There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination , harmful educational practices,  or might discourage researchers from publishing their original research openly.  Worries about AI safety risks such as privacy breaches, algorithmic biases, security concerns, ethics, and compliance barriers are accompanied by other doomsday warnings. Generative AI tools are using a data ecosystem built by open-source movements, yet often ignore the accompanying expectations of reciprocity and reasonable use, says Sylvie Delacroix, a digital-law scholar at King’s College London. The tools also risk polluting the Internet with AI-generated content of dubious quality. By failing to redirect users to the human-made sources on which they were built, LLMs could disincentivize original creation. Without putting more power into the hands of creators, the system will come under severe strain. Regulators and companies must act.\\n\\n\\nCategories: Applications of artificial intelligence, Articles with short description, Artificial intelligence, CS1 errors: generic name, Short description with empty Wikidata description', '\\n\\nTitle: Artificial intelligence art\\nSummary:\\nArtificial intelligence art is visual artwork created through the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) program.   \\nArtists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human–AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, artists have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.\\nThe increased availability of AI art tools to the general public in the 2020s AI boom provided opportunities for creating AI generated images outside of academia and professional artists. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.\\n\\n\\nCategories: 20th-century introductions, All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify, All articles needing references cleanup, All pages needing cleanup, Art controversies, Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from May 2024, Articles needing more viewpoints from May 2024, Articles slanted towards recent events from May 2024, Articles with multiple maintenance issues, Articles with short description, Artificial intelligence art, CS1 German-language sources (de), CS1 Italian-language sources (it), CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown, CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list, Computer art, Digital art, Generative artificial intelligence, Short description is different from Wikidata, Use dmy dates from August 2023, Visual arts, Wikipedia introduction cleanup from May 2024, Wikipedia references cleanup from May 2024, Works involved in plagiarism controversies', '\\n\\nTitle: Regulation of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nRegulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI).

It encompasses machine ethics and AI alignment, which aim to ensure AI systems are moral and beneficial, as well as monitoring AI systems for risks and enhancing their reliability. The field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced AI models.\\nBeyond technical research, AI safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. It gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in generative AI and public concerns voiced by researchers and CEOs about potential dangers. During the 2023 AI Safety Summit, the United States and the United Kingdom both established their own AI Safety Institute. However, researchers have expressed concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities.\\n\\n\\nCategories: AI safety, All articles lacking reliable references, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles lacking reliable references from July 2023, Articles with excerpts, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from March 2024, Artificial intelligence, CS1: long volume value, CS1 errors: missing periodical, CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of January 2024, CS1 maint: location missing publisher, Cybernetics, Existential risk from artificial general intelligence, Short description is different from Wikidata', '\\n\\nTitle: Smart city\\nSummary:\\nA smart city is an urban area that has been developed with a high level of technological advancement, utilising a variety of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data. This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.\\nCategories: All articles needing copy edit, All articles with style issues, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2024, CS1 maint: location missing publisher, Commons category link from Wikidata, Government by algorithm, Harv and Sfn no-target errors, Short description is different from Wikidata, Smart cities, Urban planning in China, Urban studies and planning terminology, Use dmy dates from February 2019, Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2024, Wikipedia articles needing copy edit from July 2024, Wikipedia articles with style issues from July 2024', '\\n\\nTitle: Regulation of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nRegulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI).

Transparency in AI involves making the processes and decisions of AI systems understandable to users and stakeholders. Accountability ensures that there are protocols for addressing adverse outcomes or biases that may arise, with designated responsibilities for oversight and remediation. Robustness and security aim to ensure that AI systems perform reliably under various conditions and are safeguarded against malicious attacks.\\nCategories: 2020 establishments, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles with imported Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 text, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from June 2024, Artificial intelligence associations, Information privacy, International Telecommunication Union, Regulation of artificial intelligence, Short description is different from Wikidata, United Nations Economic and Social Council', '\\n\\nTitle: The MANIAC\\nSummary:\\nThe MANIAC is a 2023 novel by Chilean author Benjamín Labatut, written in English.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.

It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.\\nAn economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).\\nAn economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.\\nCategories: Articles with excerpts, Articles with short description, CS1 errors: missing periodical, Economics, Evaluation methods, Short description matches Wikidata, Webarchive template wayback links', '\\n\\nTitle: Technological singularity\\nSummary:\\nThe technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for Human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good\\'s intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of self-improvement cycles, each successive; and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing a rapid increase (\"explosion\") in intelligence which would ultimately result in a powerful superintelligence, qualitatively far surpassing all human intelligence.\\nThe Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann (1903-1957) became the first known person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge – first in 1983 (in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",) and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, (in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate). He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\\'s 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\\nSome prominent technologists and academics – including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore – dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and an associated artificial-intelligence explosion. One claim made was that the artificial-intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.\\nCategories: All articles that may have off-topic sections, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles with hAudio microformats, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from April 2018, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2012, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017, Articles with unsourced statements from May 2024, CS1: long volume value, Existential risk from artificial general intelligence, Harv and Sfn no-target errors, IMDb title ID not in Wikidata, Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback via Module:Annotated link, Philosophy of artificial intelligence, Science fiction themes, Short description is different from Wikidata, Singularitarianism, Spoken articles, Use dmy dates from March 2023, Webarchive template wayback links, Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2024, Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from May 2024, Wikipedia articles that may have off-topic sections from October 2021', '\\n\\nTitle: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nThe environmental impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) may vary significantly.

Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\\nAutomation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control complexity.\\nIn the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that the industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.\\nThe World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.\\nCategories: All accuracy disputes, All articles needing additional references, All articles that may contain original research, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles containing video clips, Articles needing additional references from May 2019, Articles that may contain original research from March 2018, Articles with disputed statements from October 2013, Articles with excerpts, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from June 2024, Articles with unsourced statements from May 2021, Articles with unsourced statements from October 2013, Articles with unsourced statements from September 2017, Automation, CS1 French-language sources (fr), CS1 German-language sources (de), CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of July 2024, Free-content attribution, Free content from FAO, Pages using Sister project links with default search, Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch, Short description is different from Wikidata, Use dmy dates from July 2020, Webarchive template wayback links, Wikipedia further reading cleanup, Wikipedia spam cleanup from March 2023\", \"\\n\\nTitle: Machine learning\\nSummary:\\nMachine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.

A phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent, as consumer products are embedded with digital services and devices.\\nAccording to the WEF, 70% of the global economy will be made up of digital technology over the next 10 years (from 2020 onwards). This is a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the tendency to go online. The future of work, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the digital economy. More people are now working online, and with the increase of online activity that contributes to the global economy, companies that support the systems of the Internet are more profitable.\\n\\nDigital transformation of the economy alters conventional notions about how businesses are structured, how consumers obtain goods and services, and how states need to adapt to new regulatory challenges. The digital economy has the potential to shape economic interactions between states, businesses and individuals profoundly.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\").

It can also augment and exceed human capabilities by providing faster or new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Using AI in healthcare has the potential improve predicting, diagnosing and treating diseases. Through machine learning algorithms and deep learning, AI can analyse large sets of clinical data and electronic health records and can help to diagnose the disease more quickly and precisely.\\nAI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care.\\nBecause radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.\\nAs widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and related industries. \\nUsing AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases.

Research about AI in higher education is widespread in the global north, where there is much hype from venture capital, big tech and some open educationalists. Some believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionized with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved.  There is at present, no scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI This has not hampered the growth of  Ai systems which offer scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.   Ai brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, Ai \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect. Ai also introduces hazards, such as skewed scientific knowledge dissemination , harmful educational practices,  or might discourage researchers from publishing their original research openly.  Worries about AI safety risks such as privacy breaches, algorithmic biases, security concerns, ethics, and compliance barriers are accompanied by other doomsday warnings. Generative AI tools are using a data ecosystem built by open-source movements, yet often ignore the accompanying expectations of reciprocity and reasonable use, says Sylvie Delacroix, a digital-law scholar at King’s College London. The tools also risk polluting the Internet with AI-generated content of dubious quality. By failing to redirect users to the human-made sources on which they were built, LLMs could disincentivize original creation. Without putting more power into the hands of creators, the system will come under severe strain.

This data is then used to manage assets, resources and services in an efficient manner, with the understanding that this data will in turn be used to improve operations across the city. This data can be collected from a number of sources, including citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed in order to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, urban forestry, water supply networks, waste disposal, criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The term \\'smart city\\' is defined by two key aspects: the ways in which their local governments harness technology as well as in how they monitor, analyze, plan, and govern the city. In a smart city, the sharing of data is not confined to the municipal authority but extends to businesses, citizens and other third parties who can derive benefit from the utilisation of that data. The pooling of data from disparate systems and sectors creates opportunities for enhanced understanding and economic gain.\\nThe smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the Internet of things (IOT) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a conventional \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear in its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations. Many cities have already adopted some sort of smart city technology.\\nSmart city initiatives have been criticized as largely driven by unreliable corporations, poorly adapted to residents\\' needs, as largely unsuccessful, and as a dangerous move toward totalitarian surveillance.\\nCategories: All articles needing copy edit, All articles with style issues, All articles with unsourced statements, Articles with short description, Articles with unsourced statements from July 2024, CS1 maint: location missing publisher, Commons category link from Wikidata, Government by algorithm, Harv and Sfn no-target errors, Short description is different from Wikidata, Smart cities, Urban planning in China, Urban studies and planning terminology, Use dmy dates from February 2019, Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2024, Wikipedia articles needing copy edit from July 2024, Wikipedia articles with style issues from July 2024', '\\n\\nTitle: Regulation of artificial intelligence\\nSummary:\\nRegulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI).
